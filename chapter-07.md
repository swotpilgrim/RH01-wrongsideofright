# Chapter 7: Walls Cracking

The lessons became a pattern over the next two weeks. Elizabeth would arrive Saturday mornings, and we'd work on whatever I'd planned—tire changing, battery maintenance, fluid levels, troubleshooting.

But somewhere along the way, the lessons became less about cars and more about the time between. The conversations. The lunch breaks. The way she looked at me when I explained something.

The third Saturday, she brought roast chicken sandwiches and lemonade, and we sat on the crates, oil-stained and comfortable.

"Tell me about your motorcycle," she said, biting into her sandwich. "You said you rebuilt it?"

"Yeah. Found it in a junkyard three years ago. Frame was good but everything else was trashed. Spent two years rebuilding her piece by piece."

"That must have taken forever."

"Every spare dollar and every free hour." I took a drink of lemonade—homemade, better than anything from a store. "But she's mine. Every bolt, every part. I know her inside and out because I built her."

"That's why you named her Chief."

"That's why."

Elizabeth was quiet for a moment, thinking. "I wish I had something like that. Something that was mine because I made it, not because my father bought it for me."

"You changed your own oil. Adjusted your own valves."

"With your help."

"You did the work. I just showed you where things were." I set down my sandwich. "That's yours. The knowledge, the skill. Nobody bought that for you."

Her smile was soft, grateful. "I never thought of it that way."

"You should."

"My father asked again about why my car needs so much attention," Elizabeth said quietly.

"What did you tell him?"

"That I'm learning preventive maintenance. He seemed to accept it. But he's suspicious about how often I'm here."

"Maybe you should come less often."

"I don't want to."

My chest tightened. "Elizabeth—"

"I know this is complicated. That people would talk. That my father would be furious." She met my eyes. "But I like being here, Jake. I like that you don't treat me like I'm decorative or fragile."

"You're not any of those things."

"I know that when I'm here. The rest of the time, I forget." She wrapped her arms around herself. "Do you know what it's like to always be on display? Every word weighed, every choice made for you?"

I thought about being Roy Cooper's kid. About the town deciding who I was before I opened my mouth. About the way people crossed the street to avoid me, the way teachers had looked at me like I was already a lost cause, the way every mistake confirmed what they'd always believed about me.

"Yeah," I said. "I know what that's like."

"Then you understand why I keep coming back. Why I need this." She gestured at the garage, at me. "You're the only person who sees me instead of the mayor's daughter."

"That's not true. Your friends—"

"My friends see what they're supposed to see. Linda's sweet but she'd be horrified if she knew I was spending my Saturdays learning about carburetors. The boys my father introduces me to see a prize, not a person. Even my father—" Her voice caught. "He loves me. I know he does. But he loves the daughter he wants me to be, not who I actually am."

I didn't know what to say to that. Didn't know how to tell her I understood without admitting how much I'd started to care, how much these Saturdays had started to mean.

"You should be careful," I said instead. "Your father's not stupid. He'll figure it out eventually."

"I know. But until he does—" She looked at me, those blue-gray eyes steady. "Can we keep going? Please?"

I should've said no. Should've explained that this was getting too dangerous, that we were playing with fire, that someone was going to get burned.

"Yeah," I heard myself say. "We can keep going."

Her relief was visible, physical. "Thank you."

The fourth Saturday, Elizabeth didn't bring lunch. She arrived looking tired, shadows under her eyes, her smile strained.

"You okay?" I asked.

"Just a bad night. My father had people over for dinner—potential donors for his reelection campaign. I had to smile and make small talk for four hours." She rubbed her temples. "I'm fine. What are we learning today?"

"Spark plugs. How to check them, when to replace them, gap settings."

We worked in quieter comfort than usual, Elizabeth focused but distracted. I showed her how to remove a spark plug, how to read the electrode wear, how to measure the gap with the feeler gauges she was getting better at using.

"You're good at this," she said, watching me demonstrate the gapping tool. "Teaching, I mean. Have you ever thought about doing it professionally?"

"Teaching?" The idea had never occurred to me. "Nobody's going to hire Roy Cooper's kid to teach anything."

"That's not true."

"It is in this town." I handed her the spark plug and gapping tool. "Try it. Should be point-zero-three-five inches."

She worked carefully, adjusting the gap, checking it with the feeler gauge, adjusting again. "There. Is that right?"

I checked it. Perfect. "That's right. See? You're a natural."

"Only because you're patient with me."

"Patience has nothing to do with it. You're smart and you pay attention. That's what matters."

She looked at me for a long moment, something unreadable in her expression. "Why do you do that?"

"Do what?"

"Act like the things I'm good at don't count. Like being smart or capable is just normal, nothing special."

"Because it is normal. For you, anyway."

"No one else treats it like that. Everyone else acts like it's surprising when I understand something, or sweet when I ask questions, or amusing when I want to learn." Her frustration was clear now. "You're the only one who treats my brain like it actually matters."

"It does matter. More than pearls and pretty dresses and knowing which fork to use."

"Try telling that to my father."

We finished the spark plugs in silence, Elizabeth's earlier distraction replaced by simmering frustration. When we were done, she didn't leave right away. Just stood there in the garage, looking lost.

"I don't want to go home," she said quietly.

"Elizabeth—"

"I know. I have to. But just—can I stay a little longer? We can talk about books or you can show me something else about engines or we can just sit here. I just don't want to go back to that house and be the perfect daughter yet."

Every warning bell in my head was ringing. But the look on her face—tired and frustrated and trapped—I couldn't send her away.

"Okay. A little longer."

We sat on the crates, and Elizabeth asked about the custom motorcycles I wanted to build someday. I showed her the sketches I'd drawn, the designs I'd been working on in spare moments, ideas that felt too big for someone like me but maybe possible if I ever scraped together enough money.

She looked at each sketch seriously, asking questions about design choices and mechanical challenges, treating my dreams like they were valid instead of ridiculous.

"You should do this," she said. "Really do it. Open your own shop, build custom bikes."

"That takes money I don't have and a reputation I'll never get. Nobody's going to trust Roy Cooper's kid with a custom build."

"Then leave Millbrook. Go somewhere no one knows your father's name. Start over."

The idea was intoxicating and terrifying. "Just leave?"

"Why not? What's keeping you here?"

Ma. Sam. The garage that was the only place I'd ever been good at something. The familiar tracks I crossed every day, the rental house that was home even if it wasn't much.

And now Elizabeth, though I couldn't say that out loud.

"It's not that simple."

"It could be. You're eighteen, Jake. You can go anywhere, be anyone. You don't have to stay trapped by what people think they know about you."

"Says the girl who can't tell her father she's learning car maintenance."

It came out harsher than I meant it. Elizabeth flinched.

"You're right. I'm trapped too. By different walls, maybe, but still trapped." She stood, gathered her things. "I should go. I'm sorry for keeping you so long."

"Elizabeth, wait—"

"No, you're right. I shouldn't complain about my cage when I won't even try to open the door." She headed for her Chevrolet, and I followed.

"I didn't mean it like that."

"I know. But it's true anyway." She climbed into the driver's seat, then looked back at me. "Same time next week?"

"Same time."

She drove away, and I stood in the empty lot feeling like I'd broken something I didn't know how to fix.

That's when Tommy's Triumph pulled up, the beat-up bike sputtering to a stop beside me.

"That the mayor's daughter?" he asked, killing the engine.

"Yeah."

"People are starting to talk, Jake."

I went cold. "What people?"

"Larry saw her car here last Saturday. Mrs. Henderson mentioned to Sam that the Hayes girl seems to be here a lot. My sister Linda said Elizabeth's been vague about where she spends her Saturdays." Tommy climbed off his bike, expression serious. "It's a small town. People notice things."

"I'm teaching her car maintenance. That's all."

"Is it?"

I didn't answer.

"Jake, listen. I don't care if you're teaching her or if there's more going on. You're my friend and I want you happy. But the mayor's daughter?" Tommy shook his head. "This can't end well. Either her father finds out and destroys you, or she realizes you're not from her world and moves on. Either way, you get hurt."

"I know."

"Then why are you doing it?"

Because when Elizabeth looked at me, I felt like someone worth seeing. Because she made me think maybe I could be more than Roy Cooper's kid stuck in a garage in a small town where everyone had already decided my future. Because I was falling in love with her and couldn't seem to stop myself even though I knew better.

"I don't know," I lied.

Tommy sighed. "Just be careful, okay? That's all I'm saying. Be careful."

He left, and I stood alone in the empty garage, surrounded by tools and motor oil and the lingering scent of Elizabeth's perfume.

Sam was right. Tommy was right. This couldn't end well.

But Saturday suddenly seemed very far away, and I was already counting the days.
