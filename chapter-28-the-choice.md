# Chapter 28: The Choice

The crowd's mostly dispersed when Mayor Hayes comes back.

Elizabeth's hand tightens in mine. "He's not done."

The mayor stops a few feet away. His face is still hard, but something's changed. He's not here to threaten. He's here to test.

"Mr. Cooper," he says. Formal. Cold. "I have a question for you."

"Sir."

"Do you think you can provide the life my daughter deserves?"

Everyone nearby waits for my answer.

This is it. The real test. Not whether I love Elizabeth, but whether I'm willing to commit to an uncertain future. Whether I'm willing to take responsibility for her happiness when I can barely manage my own.

"Think carefully," Mayor Hayes says. "This isn't about love or feelings. This is about reality. About whether you're willing to take responsibility for my daughter's future."

Elizabeth starts to object but he holds up a hand. "Let him answer."

I look at Elizabeth. At her determined face, her faith in me written all over her expression. Then back at her father.

"I don't know," I say honestly. "I don't know if I can provide the life you think she deserves."

The mayor's expression says he knew it. That I've just confirmed everything he thought about me.

"But I'm willing to try. I'm willing to work for it. Every day. Whatever it takes."

"Willing isn't the same as able."

"No sir. But it's what I've got. I don't have money or education or prospects. What I have is a plan and the willingness to work myself to the bone."

"This motorcycle business." The mayor's tone is skeptical.

"Yes sir. Custom motorcycles. It'll take years. Years of working at Sam's, saving every dollar, learning everything I can. But I've been planning it. Drawing designs, researching, figuring out costs and timelines."

"And if it fails?"

"Then I figure out something else. Find another way. But I don't quit."

The mayor studies me. "You know that's not enough. Not for someone with Elizabeth's potential."

"Maybe not. But here's what I can offer." I take a breath. "I can offer honesty. I won't lie to her or hide things or pretend I'm something I'm not. I can offer loyalty—I'll stand by her even when things get hard. I can offer effort—I'll work harder than anyone you could pick for her to build something we can both be proud of." I pause. "And I can offer to see her. Really see her. Not as a possession or a campaign prop or someone to control. As a person with her own dreams and thoughts and right to choose her own life."

"That's a nice speech. But speeches don't pay bills."

"You're right. But I've got thirty-seven dollars saved toward that business. I've got Sam's training and eight years' experience. I've got designs for three custom bike models. Contacts with suppliers and a timeline for when I can open a shop." The words come faster. "I don't have everything figured out. But I've got more than dreams. I've got a plan. And I'm asking you to give me a chance to prove it."

The crowd's completely silent. Even the parade music seems distant.

"Why should I?" the mayor asks. "Why should I trust that you won't become your father? That you won't drag Elizabeth down with you?"

It's the question I've been asking myself for months. The fear that's kept me awake at night. That I'm Roy Cooper's son and no matter how hard I try, I'll end up just like him.

"Because I'm not him," I say. "I know everyone sees his name when they look at me. But I'm not my father. He ran from his responsibilities. I face mine. He made excuses. I make efforts. He hurt people who loved him. I protect them."

"Those are just words—"

"They're not. Ask Sam if I've ever missed a day of work in eight years. Ask my mother if I've ever come home drunk. Ask Tommy if I've ever let him down." My voice gets stronger. "I'm not perfect. I'm scared I'm not good enough. But I show up. Every day. For every person who depends on me. That's not my father. That's me."

Mayor Hayes is quiet for a long moment. Then: "And what about Elizabeth? Can you promise you won't hurt her?"

"No sir."

His eyebrows raise.

"I can't promise that. I'll probably mess up. Say the wrong thing, make mistakes, fail in ways I can't predict. I'm eighteen and figuring things out as I go." I look at Elizabeth, then back at her father. "But I can promise I'll never hurt her on purpose. I can promise I'll apologize when I'm wrong. I can promise I'll listen when she tells me I've messed up. And I can promise I'll never, ever try to control her the way—" I stop.

"The way I do?" the mayor finishes. His voice is dangerous.

"The way anyone has," I correct carefully. "Elizabeth deserves to make her own choices. Even when they're hard. Even when they might be mistakes. She's smart enough and brave enough to handle the consequences."

"And when those consequences affect you both? When her choices impact your life and your choices impact hers?"

"Then we'll deal with them together. Like partners." I squeeze Elizabeth's hand. "I'm not asking to take her away from you, sir. Or to take over your role in her life. I'm just asking for a chance to be part of it. To build something with her. To support her dreams while I'm building mine."

The mayor looks at me for what feels like forever. Measuring. Judging. Trying to decide if I'm worth the risk.

Then he turns to Elizabeth. "Is this what you want?"

"Yes," she says immediately.

"You understand what you're choosing? The gossip, the scandal, the financial uncertainty?"

"I understand."

"And you still want this?"

"I want Jake. Everything else we'll figure out."

The mayor's jaw works. I can see the war in his face—fear for his daughter battling against the reality that he can't control this. That forcing her away from me will only push her further from him.

"I can't support this," he says finally.

My heart sinks. Elizabeth's grip on my hand tightens painfully.

"But," the mayor continues slowly, "I won't actively oppose it either."

Wait. What?

"If you're serious about this business," he says to me, "I'll be watching. I want to see that timeline. Those designs. Proof that this isn't just talk. If you're making real progress, working toward something actual, then..." He trails off.

"Then what?" Elizabeth asks.

"Then I won't interfere. I won't threaten Sam's business or your mother's job. I won't use my position to make your life difficult." He looks at me hard. "But the moment I think you're not serious, that you're wasting her time or leading her on with empty promises, all bets are off. Understood?"

"Yes sir."

"And if you hurt her—if you become the man your father was—I will make it my personal mission to ensure you regret it."

"Dad," Elizabeth says warningly.

"It's fair," I say. "More than fair. You're giving me a chance. That's more than I expected."

The mayor nods once. "Don't make me regret it."

Then he does something that shocks me. He holds out his hand.

I stare at it for a second, then shake it. His grip is firm, testing, but it's a handshake. An agreement.

"Take care of her," he says quietly. "Or answer to me."

"Yes sir."

He lets go, looks at Elizabeth. "We'll talk at home."

"Not if you're going to threaten him more—"

"We'll talk," he repeats. "About how this is going to work. Ground rules. Expectations. Like adults."

Elizabeth blinks. "Adults?"

"You wanted to be treated like one. This is what that looks like. Actual conversations about actual consequences." He straightens his jacket. "I expect you home by six for dinner. We have things to discuss."

Then he walks away. For real this time. Heading toward the parked cars without looking back.

I can't quite process what just happened.

"Did your father just—did he—"

"He gave us a chance," Elizabeth says wonderingly. "An actual chance."

"With conditions."

"With conditions," she agrees. "But still. A chance."

Sam appears beside us, grinning. "Well hell. Didn't think you'd pull that off."

"Pull what off?"

"Earning Hayes's conditional approval. That's more than anyone's gotten from him in years."

"He's still going to watch me like a hawk."

"Course he is. You're dating his daughter. But he shook your hand, Jake. That means something."

Tommy whistles low. "You just negotiated with the mayor. In public. And lived."

"Barely."

"But you did." Elizabeth turns to face me fully. "You stood up to him. Told him your plans. Made promises." Her eyes are shining. "And he listened."

"Because you made him listen."

"We made him listen. Together." She kisses me quick, right there in front of Sam and Tommy and whoever else is still watching. "Partners."

"Partners," I echo.

The word feels heavy. Weighted with all the promises I just made. To build something. To work harder than I ever have. To be worthy of the chance her father just grudgingly gave me.

But looking at Elizabeth's face—proud and hopeful and absolutely certain—the weight doesn't feel crushing.

It feels like purpose.

Like maybe, just maybe, I can actually do this.

Not because it'll be easy. Not because I have all the answers.

But because I'm not doing it alone.

Sam claps me on the shoulder. "Come by the garage tomorrow. Want to talk about that motorcycle business. See those designs."

"Really?"

"Really. If you're serious about this, you're gonna need help. Equipment, space, expertise. I'm not saying it'll be easy. But if you're willing to put in the work, I'm willing to help you figure it out."

My throat closes up. "Sam—"

"Don't get emotional on me. Just show up tomorrow ready to work." He winks. "Now go watch the parade with your girl. You earned it."

The parade. Right. I forgot there was supposed to be a celebration today.

Elizabeth pulls me toward Main Street where the band's playing and people are lined up watching. We slip into the crowd, her hand in mine, and for the first time since this whole day started I let myself breathe.

We did it.

Stood up to her father. Made our case. Earned a conditional, fragile chance.

It's not everything. Not approval or acceptance or the easy road forward.

But it's a start.

And sometimes a start is all you need.
