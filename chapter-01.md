# Chapter 1: Wrong Side of Everything

The morning sun sliced through the threadbare curtains of my room, catching dust motes in the air like they had somewhere important to be. They didn't. Neither did I. But that never stopped the sun from coming up over Millbrook, Indiana, same as it always did, turning everything the color of old pennies before the heat really set in.

I lay there a minute, staring at the water stain on the ceiling that looked like a map of nowhere, listening to the silence that meant Ma had already left for her shift at Rosie's Diner. Five in the morning she started, serving coffee and eggs to folks who probably didn't think twice about who poured their refills. The house creaked around me, small and tired, same as everything on this side of the tracks.

My room wasn't much—single bed with a blanket Ma got at the church sale, dresser with a drawer that stuck, and the parts of my motorcycle spread across newspapers on the floor like a patient mid-surgery. I'd been rebuilding the carburetor for a week now, getting it perfect. The bike was mine, rebuilt from salvage and sweat and every spare dollar I could scrape together. A '52 Indian Chief that everybody said was trash until I made it run like a dream.

I sat up, reached under the bed, and pulled out the library book I'd hidden there beneath a stack of hot rod magazines. The Grapes of Wrath. I'd read it twice already, but I kept checking it out again, kept it hidden like contraband. Jake Cooper reading Steinbeck—that'd give the town something to talk about, right after they finished laughing. High school dropout greaser trying to be educated. Funny.

I shoved the book back under and grabbed my jeans off the chair. The day wasn't going to start itself.

Twenty minutes later I was straddling my bike in front of the house, leather jacket on despite the heat already building. The jacket wasn't optional. It was part of the uniform—greaser, wrong side of the tracks, Roy Cooper's kid. People expected the leather and the attitude, so I gave it to them. Easier than fighting about who I was supposed to be.

The engine roared to life, sweet and strong, every adjustment I'd made singing through the pipes. This was the one place I knew I was good—engines made sense. You put the right parts in the right places, tuned them properly, treated them with respect, and they ran. Didn't matter whose kid you were or what your old man did before he walked out. Metal and gasoline didn't care about reputation.

I kicked off and headed west, toward the respectable part of town.

The railroad tracks cut straight through Millbrook like a scar, dividing everything that mattered from everything that didn't. East side—that was us. Rental houses with peeling paint, the lumber yard, the bottling plant, streets that turned to gravel and dust. West side—that was them. Tree-lined avenues with names like Elm and Maple, houses with porches and flower boxes, the town square with its white church and pristine courthouse steps.

I crossed the tracks same as every morning, feeling the bump and rattle under my tires, the physical reminder of the line I crossed for work. Sam's Garage sat just on the respectable side, close enough to the tracks that the west-siders could bring their cars in without venturing too far into our territory, far enough that they didn't have to admit they were doing business with east-side grease monkeys.

The garage was already open when I pulled up, bay doors rolled high, the smell of motor oil and solvent thick in the humid morning air. Sam Henderson was bent over the engine of a '55 Ford, his Korean War limp making him favor his left side. He glanced up when he heard my bike, nodded once, and went back to work. That was Sam—didn't waste words when a nod would do.

I parked the Indian next to the building, ran my hand over the seat once—habit, checking she was real—and headed inside.

"Transmission on the Dodge needs pulling," Sam said without preamble, wiping his hands on a rag that'd been red once, maybe ten years ago. "Customer wants it done by tomorrow."

"I'll get on it."

Sam studied me a moment, eyes sharp under bushy gray eyebrows. "You stay out of trouble last night?"

"Went home. Read." I didn't mention the book. "Nothing worth reporting, Sheriff Henderson."

His mouth twitched. Closest thing to a smile Sam allowed himself. "Keep it that way. Don't need you getting into fights and showing up here with busted knuckles again. Bad for business."

"That was one time."

"Two times. I count better than you do."

Fair enough. I grabbed my work coveralls from the hook and headed to the Dodge. The transmission was a mess—second gear grinding, syncros probably shot. Whoever'd been driving this thing had been rough with the clutch. But transmission work was good work. Methodical. Puzzle pieces that only fit one way. I could lose myself in it, forget about everything else.

The morning passed in the steady rhythm of tools and grunt work. Drain the fluid. Drop the driveshaft. Unbolt the crossmember. Everything had an order, a sequence that made sense. My hands moved sure and steady, grease working its way under my fingernails where it lived permanently now. I'd scrubbed until my skin was raw once, trying to get clean for a school assembly back when I still went to school. Hadn't worked then. Didn't bother trying now.

Around noon, Tommy Blake rolled up on his Triumph, the beat-up bike sputtering like it had a chest cold. Tommy'd been my best friend since we were eight years old and discovered we both lived on the wrong side of everything that counted. He worked at the lumber yard, hauling boards and running the saw, came away every day smelling like fresh-cut pine and sweat.

"Hey, Cooper!" He swung off the bike, grinning. "You coming out to the quarry tonight? Davey's talking about drag racing, see whose bike's fastest."

I wiped my hands, leaned against the Dodge. "Davey's bike couldn't outrun my grandma's wheelchair."

"That's what I told him. But he's got something to prove, you know how it is." Tommy pulled a cigarette from behind his ear, offered me one. I shook my head. He shrugged and lit up. "Come on, Jake. It's summer. We gotta do something or we'll die of boredom before September."

"Some of us have work."

"Some of us have to live a little too." He blew smoke toward the garage ceiling. "What else we got? This is it, man. This town, these jobs, this life. Might as well have some fun while we're young enough to enjoy it."

He wasn't wrong. This was it—the garage, the lumber yard, the factory if you were lucky. Maybe the army if you were desperate or patriotic, though Tommy and I had watched enough guys come back from Korea with Sam's kind of limp or worse. Our options were limited and everyone knew it.

"I'll think about it," I said.

"You always think about it. Then you show up anyway because you know I'm right." Tommy grinned, cocky and easy in a way I'd never managed. "Bring the Indian. Show Davey what a real bike sounds like."

"Get out of here before Sam decides you're distracting his employees."

"Employee. Singular. He's only got you." But Tommy swung back onto his Triumph, kicked it into sputtering life. "See you tonight, Cooper!"

He roared off, trailing blue smoke and the kind of easy confidence that came from accepting exactly what life handed you. Tommy never fought it. Never wondered if there was something else. Just took what came and made the best of it.

I envied that sometimes.

I was elbow-deep in the Dodge transmission when Sam came over, holding a clipboard and looking like he had news he wasn't thrilled about delivering.

"Mayor Hayes's Buick's getting towed in," he said. "Engine trouble. Needs it looked at soon as possible."

I glanced up. "Mayor Hayes?"

"That's right. The 1955 Special. Called it in this morning, AAA's bringing it over within the hour."

I went back to the transmission, kept my voice neutral. "Just another car."

"Just another car that belongs to the most important man in town," Sam said. "Which means you do it right, no shortcuts, and you're polite if anyone from that family shows up asking questions. Understand?"

"I'm always polite."

Sam snorted. "You're professional. There's a difference. With the mayor's car, I need polite."

"Got it."

Sam nodded, satisfied, and limped back to his office. I focused on the syncro assembly in my hands, letting the familiar work settle my thoughts. Mayor Hayes's Buick. Big deal. It was just metal and gasoline, same as every other car that came through these bay doors. Didn't matter who owned it or what kind of house they drove it home to.

Just another repair job.

I told myself that twice more before I believed it.

The afternoon heat pressed down on the garage like a heavy hand, and I worked through it, sweat making my t-shirt stick to my back. The transmission started giving up its secrets—worn syncros, just like I thought, and a cracked input shaft bearing that explained the grinding. Good diagnosis. Clean repair. The kind of work that made me think maybe I was good at something after all.

Outside, Millbrook went about its summer business—cars passing on Main Street, the sound of the bell from the church steeple marking the hour, someone's radio playing Elvis across the way. The wrong side and the right side and the tracks running between them like a scar that never healed.

And me in the middle, hands covered in grease, rebuilding transmissions for people who'd cross the street to avoid me anywhere else.

Just another day on the wrong side of right.
