# Chapter 11: Trying to Stay Away

I woke up Tuesday morning knowing I should end this.

The thought had been building for days. Sam's warning about Elizabeth having options I didn't. Tommy's concerned look. My daydreams about a future that couldn't exist.

This was heading somewhere dangerous. Not just for me—for Elizabeth. Her reputation. Her relationship with her father. Her future.

She deserved better than sneaking around with Roy Cooper's kid. Someone respectable. Someone her father would approve of. Someone who wouldn't destroy her future.

The smart thing was to end it before we got deeper.

I spent the morning trying to work up the courage.

Elizabeth was meeting me that evening. I'd tell her then. Explain this was for her own good. She'd be hurt, but eventually she'd understand.

I told myself that all morning while I worked and tried not to think about her smile.

"You're quiet today," Sam observed around noon.

"Just thinking."

"About the mayor's daughter?"

I didn't answer. Sam sighed.

"You're gonna do something stupid, aren't you?"

"Actually, I'm gonna do something smart. For once." I set down the wrench. "I'm ending it. Tonight. Before it goes any further."

Sam studied me for a long moment. "That what you want to do?"

"It's what I should do."

"That's not what I asked."

I looked at my hands—grease-stained, callused, scarred. Working hands. Elizabeth deserved better.

"No," I admitted. "It's not what I want. But it's right."

"Maybe." Sam leaned against the workbench. "Or maybe you're protecting yourself by ending it before she can hurt you."

"I'm protecting her. From me. From what being with me would cost her."

"You ever think maybe she's old enough to decide what she's willing to risk?"

"She's seventeen. She doesn't know what she's risking."

"She's smart enough to adjust valves and change her own oil. I think she's smart enough to understand consequences." Sam picked up the wrench I'd set down. "I'm not saying you're wrong. That girl's father could make your life hell. But if you're gonna end it, make sure it's for the right reasons. Not because you're scared of getting hurt or because you don't think you deserve her."

He went back to the office, and I stood there thinking. Was I protecting Elizabeth or protecting myself?

The afternoon dragged. Every hour brought me closer to the quarry, closer to ending this.

At five I locked up and headed out of town, riding the back roads with my stomach in knots. Make sure it's for the right reasons.

Elizabeth's Chevrolet was already there. She was sitting on the limestone edge, shoes off, watching the water. When she heard my motorcycle she turned, and her smile was bright enough to hurt.

"Hi," she called.

"Hi."

I killed the engine and walked over. She stood to greet me, wearing a simple sundress, blue with white trim, her hair loose around her shoulders. She looked happy.

This was going to kill me.

"I was hoping you'd come early," she said. "I've been dying to tell you—my father's going out of town this weekend. Political event in Indianapolis. He'll be gone all day Saturday. We could actually do something in daylight. Maybe ride out to the state park, or go to that diner two towns over where nobody knows us—"

"Elizabeth." My voice came out rough. "We need to talk."

Her smile faltered. "That sounds ominous."

"Can we sit?"

We sat on the limestone edge, and I tried to find words. How do you tell someone you're falling for them that it has to end?

"I've been thinking," I started. "About us. About where this is heading."

"Okay..." She was watching me carefully now, smile completely gone.

"This can't work, Elizabeth. You know that, right? Your father, the town, your future—everything's stacked against us. We've been pretending it doesn't matter, but it does."

"Jake—"

"Let me finish. Please." I looked at the quarry water instead of at her. "You're going to college. You've got this whole life ahead of you, opportunities most people don't get. And I'm going to be at the garage, working on other people's cars, trying to save enough to maybe someday build something of my own. We're from different worlds, and no amount of wanting changes that."

"So what are you saying?"

"I'm saying we should stop. Before this goes any further. Before someone gets hurt."

The silence that followed felt heavy enough to crush me. Then Elizabeth spoke, and her voice was cold in a way I'd never heard before.

"Before someone gets hurt? Or before you get hurt?"

I looked at her then, and her eyes were blazing.

"Because it sounds to me like you're protecting yourself, not me. Like you're scared of what might happen so you're running away before it can."

"I'm trying to do the right thing—"

"The right thing for who? For me? Did you ask me what I want?" She stood, and I stood with her. "Or did you just decide on your own that I'm too delicate or too important or too whatever to make my own choices?"

"Your father—"

"My father doesn't own me. Neither does this town. And neither do you." She was furious now, face flushed, hands clenched into fists. "I'm so sick of people deciding what's best for me without bothering to ask what I actually want."

"What you want doesn't change reality, Elizabeth. Your father finds out about us, he destroys me. The town finds out, they destroy you. That's not fear, that's fact."

"Then we're careful. We wait until I'm eighteen, until I'm in college, until we have more freedom. But we don't just give up because it's hard."

"It's not just hard, it's impossible."

"Says who? Your father ran away from hard things and look where it got him. Are you really going to be like him? Give up on something good because you're afraid?"

That hit like a punch to the gut. "That's not fair."

"None of this is fair!" Her voice cracked. "It's not fair that I have to lie to my father to see you. It's not fair that you think you don't deserve good things. It's not fair that the town gets to decide who belongs together. But that doesn't mean we give up."

"I'm trying to protect you."

"I don't need protecting. I need you to be honest with me." She stepped closer. "Is this really about me? About my reputation or my father or my future? Or is this about you being scared?"

I wanted to lie. Wanted to say this was all about her, about doing the noble thing, about sacrifice and protection. But Elizabeth was looking at me with those blue-gray eyes and I couldn't do it.

"Yeah," I said. "I'm scared. Terrified. Because you could leave anytime—go to college, meet someone your father approves of, realize this was just rebellion. And I'd be left with nothing. You'd move on and I'd still be Roy Cooper's kid stuck in a garage in a town that hates me."

"You really think that's all this is to me? Rebellion?"

"I don't know. How could I know? You've never had to choose between me and everything else. It's easy to say it doesn't matter when you haven't lost anything yet."

Elizabeth's anger shifted into something else. Hurt. Disappointment. "You don't get it, do you? I've already chosen. Every time I lie to my father, every time I risk getting caught, every time I show up here—I'm choosing you. And you're telling me it doesn't count because I haven't lost enough yet?"

"That's not what I meant—"

"Then what did you mean, Jake? Because from where I'm standing, it sounds like you've already decided this is doomed and you're just looking for an excuse to end it before it gets too real."

She was right. Sam was right. I was protecting myself, hiding behind noble reasons when really I was just scared of being hurt. Scared of wanting something this much. Scared of believing I could have it.

"I don't want to be like my father," I said quietly. "Don't want to ruin good things. Don't want to be the reason you lose everything."

"You're not your father." Elizabeth's voice was softer now. "And I'm not losing anything by being with you. I'm gaining something real. Don't you see that?"

"I see that I could destroy your life."

"Or you could be part of making it worth living." She took my hands. "I'm not asking for guarantees. I'm just asking you to not give up on us before we've even really tried."

I looked at our joined hands—hers soft, mine rough and oil-stained. Different worlds.

"What if it doesn't work?" I asked.

"Then we'll deal with it. Together." She squeezed my hands. "But what if it does work, Jake? What if we're braver than we think and stronger than they expect? Don't you want to find out?"

I thought about Sam's words. About right reasons and wrong ones. About courage and fear. About my father running away from hard things and where that had gotten him.

"Yeah," I said. "I want to find out."

"Then stop trying to protect me from my own choices." She touched my face. "I'm choosing you. Scary as it is, impossible as it might be, I'm choosing you. The question is whether you're choosing me back."

Was I? Could I be brave enough to try this even knowing all the ways it could end badly?

"I'm choosing you," I said. "I'm just terrified of screwing it up."

"Then we'll screw it up together." She smiled, and it was shaky but real. "That's how this works, right? We take turns being brave?"

I pulled her close and kissed her, and it tasted like relief and fear and hope all mixed together. When we pulled apart, I rested my forehead against hers.

"I'm sorry," I said. "For trying to decide for you. For being scared and calling it noble."

"I'm sorry too. For saying you were like your father. You're not. You're better."

We sat back down on the limestone edge, and Elizabeth leaned against me. For a little while we just existed there together.

"Your father's really going to Indianapolis this weekend?" I asked.

"All day Saturday. Some political fundraiser."

"We could go to that diner. The one two towns over."

"Yeah?" She looked up at me, hopeful.

"Yeah. If you want. Real date. Daylight. Burger and milkshake."

Her smile was worth every bit of fear. "I'd like that."

We stayed at the quarry until full dark. When we finally left I felt lighter than I had in days. Still scared. Still uncertain. But not running anymore.

We'd take turns being brave.

And maybe that would be enough.
