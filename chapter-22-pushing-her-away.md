# Chapter 22: Pushing Her Away

Three days I've avoided Elizabeth.

Took every extra shift. Worked late, came in early, made sure I was never alone when she showed up. Twice I hid in the back bay. Once I took the long way home.

Coward. Too gutless to face her and do what needs to be done.

But tonight there's no avoiding it.

I'm locking up the garage—Sam left an hour ago, Tommy's long gone—when I hear a car pull up. Not just any car. Her father's Buick. My hands freeze on the padlock.

The car door slams. Footsteps. Then her voice, tight with anger. "Jake."

I don't turn around. "You should go home, Elizabeth."

"I've been trying to see you for three days. You've been avoiding me."

"Been busy."

"Don't." The word cracks like a whip. "Don't lie to me. What's going on?"

I force myself to turn. She's ten feet away in a yellow dress, arms crossed, hurt and confusion on her face.

"Nothing's going on."

"Then why won't you talk to me?" She steps closer. "Is this about Danny? Or my father?"

Both. Neither. Everything.

"Elizabeth, just go home."

"No." Another step. "Not until you tell me what's wrong. Not until you look me in the eye and—"

"It's over." The words come out flat. Practiced. I've been rehearsing them for three days.

She stops. "What?"

"Us. This. Whatever we've been doing. It's over."

The silence feels endless. I watch her face cycle through disbelief, confusion, hurt.

"You're breaking up with me."

"Yeah."

"Why?"

Because your father threatened everyone. Because Danny's coming back. Because you deserve better. Because I love you too much to watch you throw everything away.

"Because it's time to be realistic," I say.

"Realistic." She repeats the word like it's foreign. "What does that mean?"

"Means we're from different worlds. Means this was fun while it lasted but it's not going anywhere. Means you should go back to your life and I'll go back to mine."

"Fun?" Her voice rises. "Fun? Is that what this was to you?"

"What else would it be?"

"I thought—" She stops, swallows. "I thought we loved each other."

The words hit like a fist to the gut. I force myself to stay cold, to keep my face blank. "Love isn't enough, Elizabeth."

"What?"

"Love doesn't pay bills. Doesn't change where I'm from or who my father was. Doesn't make me good enough for the mayor's daughter." I shove my hands in my pockets to hide how they're shaking. "Time to stop pretending."

"Pretending." She steps closer, tears starting. "You think I've been pretending?"

"I think you've been playing at rebellion. Dating the bad boy, making your father mad." My voice is deliberately cruel. "But that gets old. Eventually you're gonna want someone your father approves of. Someone who can give you the life you're used to. That's not me."

"You don't believe that."

"I do."

"You're lying." Her voice shakes. "You're lying because you're scared. Because my father got to you, didn't he? He threatened you."

Too smart. She's always been too smart.

"Your father had nothing to do with this."

"I don't believe you."

"Believe what you want." I turn back to the lock, fingers fumbling with the key. "Doesn't change anything. We're done."

"Jake, look at me."

I don't. Can't. If I look at her crying I won't be able to do this.

"Please. Just look at me and tell me you don't love me. If you can do that, I'll leave."

The key turns. The lock clicks. I pull it free, slip it in my pocket. All mechanical. All automatic. Because if I think about what I'm doing I'll break.

I force myself to turn. To meet her eyes. They're wet with tears, searching my face desperately for any sign that this isn't real.

"I don't love you," I say.

It's the biggest lie I've ever told. The words taste like poison. But I make myself say them anyway, make myself watch her face crumble.

"You're lying."

"I'm not."

"Then what was all of it? The quarry, the conversations, telling me you loved me—was that all fake?"

"No. It was real at the time. But I've had time to think. To see clearly. And the truth is, Elizabeth, we don't work. You're the mayor's daughter and I'm Roy Cooper's kid. That's not a fairytale. That's a disaster waiting to happen."

"So you're giving up."

"I'm being smart."

"You're being a coward." Her voice turns hard. "You're running away because things got difficult. Because my father made you scared. Because it's easier to quit than to fight."

Every word is true. Every word hurts.

"Call it what you want."

"I'm calling it cowardice. I'm calling it giving up on us because you don't think you're worth fighting for."

"Maybe I'm not."

"Don't." She's crying openly now. "Don't do that. Don't make this about your father or your worth or any of that. Be honest with me, Jake. For once, just be honest."

I am being honest. That's the problem. I'm being more honest than she can understand.

"I am being honest. What we had was nice but it's not enough. You should go home, Elizabeth. Date someone appropriate. Someone your father likes. Someone who can actually give you a future."

"I don't want someone appropriate. I want you."

God, she's making this impossible. Every word she says makes me want to take it all back, to pull her against me and tell her the truth. That I love her. That sending her away is killing me. That I'm doing this because I love her too much to destroy her.

But I can't. Her father made the consequences clear. Stay with her and watch everyone I care about suffer. Sam's business destroyed. My mother losing her job. Elizabeth's reputation ruined, her college chances gone, her whole future derailed.

I can't let that happen.

"You want me because I'm different. Exciting. The bad boy your father disapproves of." I make my voice hard. "But that wears off. Eventually you'll realize you tied yourself to someone going nowhere. And then you'll resent me."

"That's not—"

"It is. My mother married my father thinking love would be enough. It wasn't. He destroyed her life and left. I'm not doing that to you."

"You're not your father."

"I'm exactly like him." The lie comes easier now. "Same blood, same town, same nothing future. Your father sees it. The whole town sees it. When are you gonna see it?"

"Jake—"

"Do you love me?" The question comes out raw. "Or do you love the idea of me? The project, the redemption story, the good girl who saves the bad boy?"

She recoils like I slapped her. "How can you ask me that?"

"Because I need to know if this is real for you or just a story you're telling yourself."

"It's real." Tears streaming down her face now. "I love you. I love you and I don't care about any of the rest of it. Your father, my father, the town—none of it matters."

"It all matters." I shake my head. "That's what you don't understand. It all matters and it's all stacked against us. I'm doing us both a favor by ending this now before it gets worse."

"A favor?" Her voice breaks. "You think breaking my heart is a favor?"

"I think it's better than watching you throw away your future for me."

"That's my choice to make."

"And I'm making mine. This is over, Elizabeth. Go home. Forget about me. Move on."

She's staring at me like she doesn't recognize me. Like I'm a stranger wearing Jake Cooper's face. "I don't believe this. I don't believe you."

"Believe it."

"Look at me." She steps close enough to touch, her face tilted up to mine. "Look me in the eyes and tell me you don't love me. Tell me this past month meant nothing. Tell me you don't care if you never see me again. If you can do that, I'll leave."

I look at her. Really look at her. At her red eyes and tear-stained cheeks, at the hurt and confusion and desperate hope still fighting in her expression. At the girl I love more than anything standing in front of me waiting for me to tell her the truth.

And I lie.

"I don't love you," I say again. "This past month was a distraction. And honestly, I'll be relieved when you're gone."

The hope dies in her eyes. I watch it happen. Watch the moment she starts to believe me.

"You're lying," she whispers. But there's doubt now. Uncertainty.

"I'm not."

"Then you're a coward and a liar and I was wrong about you." Her voice turns cold. "I thought you were brave. I thought you were different. But you're just scared like everyone else. Too scared to fight for what you want. Too scared to believe you deserve to be happy."

"Maybe you're right."

"I know I'm right." She backs away, and I can see her heart breaking with every step. "I was stupid to think you were worth fighting for."

The words cut deeper than any of her father's threats. Because she's right. I'm not worth fighting for. Her father sees it. The town sees it. Now she's finally seeing it too.

"I'm sorry," I say, and I mean it. Sorry for everything. For letting her care about me. For making her believe we could work. For breaking her heart to save her.

"No you're not." Her voice is flat now. Dead. "If you were sorry you wouldn't be doing this."

She slaps me. Hard. The crack echoes in the empty street. My cheek burns but I don't move, don't react. Just stand there and take it because I deserve it and worse.

"Goodbye, Jake." She's walking to her car now, not running, just walking with her shoulders straight and her head up. Every inch the mayor's daughter. Dignified even in devastation.

I watch her get in the Buick, start the engine, drive away without looking back.

Then I'm alone with the echo of her car fading and her hand burning on my cheek.

I did it. I pushed her away. Protected her from me and my world and everything I'd bring into her life. Did the right thing even though it destroyed us both.

So why does it feel like the worst mistake I've ever made?

I lean against the garage door and slide down until I'm sitting on the concrete. My cheek's still burning. My chest feels like something broke inside it. And for the first time since my father left, I let myself cry.

Because I just lost the best thing that ever happened to me.

And I did it on purpose.
