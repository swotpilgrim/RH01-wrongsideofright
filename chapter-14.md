# Chapter 14: His Hidden Self

The next week fell into a pattern. Elizabeth would come to the garage for "maintenance" on Saturday mornings when Sam was there to keep things looking legitimate. Then we'd meet at the quarry in the evenings—Tuesday, Thursday, whenever her father had council meetings or events that kept him occupied.

It was dangerous and unsustainable and I couldn't bring myself to stop.

Thursday evening I was at the quarry first, sitting on the limestone edge with a book from the library. The same copy of Shane I'd told Elizabeth about at the diner. I was rereading the ending where the gunfighter rides away, leaving behind the people who'd started to matter, choosing loneliness over staying and risking their safety.

It was the third time I'd read this book. The first time, I'd thought Shane was noble. The second time, I'd thought he was tragic. Now I thought he was just scared.

I understood that choice more than I wanted to.

The sound of Elizabeth's Chevrolet made me look up. She pulled in, climbed out, and walked over with a bag from Rosie's—the Millbrook one, where Ma worked.

"Your mother packed this," she said, setting it down. "Meatloaf sandwiches. She said you've been skipping dinner too often."

My stomach dropped. "You talked to my ma?"

"I stopped by the diner to pick up dinner for my father. She recognized me and asked if I knew you from the garage." Elizabeth sat beside me. "I said yes. That you'd been helping me learn car maintenance. She seemed pleased you were being helpful."

"She doesn't know."

"About us? No. But Jake—she's going to figure it out eventually. People will figure it out."

"I know." I set down the book. "Doesn't mean I'm ready for it."

Elizabeth picked up Shane, studied the worn cover. "Is this the one you were telling me about? The gunfighter?"

"Yeah."

"Can I read the ending?"

I showed her where I'd stopped, and she read in silence for a few minutes while I unwrapped one of the sandwiches. Ma's meatloaf, still warm. She must've made it special when she saw Elizabeth coming.

That thought made my chest ache.

"He leaves," Elizabeth said, closing the book. "After everything—after he's risked everything, cared about them, saved them—he just leaves."

"He thinks it's protecting them. That his past will destroy their future if he stays."

"That's stupid."

"Elizabeth—"

"No, I mean it. It's stupid." She set the book down. "He's not protecting them. He's protecting himself from the pain of staying and risking real connection. From the vulnerability of letting people matter."

I thought about my father. About how he'd left to protect himself from responsibility and ended up destroying us anyway.

"Sometimes leaving is the right thing," I said.

"Sometimes it's the coward thing." She looked at me. "Are you thinking about leaving? About ending this to protect me?"

"Every day."

"But you don't."

"No. I don't." I met her eyes. "Because you were right. At the quarry when I tried. I was protecting myself, not you. And I'm trying to be braver than that."

Elizabeth took my hand. "Good. Because I'm not letting you go that easily."

We ate Ma's sandwiches while the sun set, talking about the book and why people ran from things that mattered and whether love was worth the risk of loss.

"My mother used to read to me," Elizabeth said quietly. "Every night before bed. Adventure stories where the heroes always won and nobody important ever died." She smiled sadly. "Then she died and I learned that was a lie. That sometimes the people you love most leave and there's nothing you can do about it."

"I'm not leaving."

"You can't promise that."

"I can promise I won't choose to leave. That I won't walk away because it's easier than staying."

She squeezed my hand. "That's enough."

The evening turned to night, stars appearing overhead one by one like tiny promises, and I showed her the constellations I knew. Orion with his belt. The Big Dipper pointing north toward home. Cassiopeia's W shape sitting on the horizon.

"My dad taught me those," I said. "Before he left. We'd sit on the back steps on clear summer nights and he'd show me how to navigate by stars, how to find your way if you were lost in the dark."

"Do you have good memories of him? From before?"

"Some. He taught me about engines. Took me fishing a couple times. But mostly I remember waiting. Waiting for him to come home from work. Waiting for him to keep promises he never kept. Waiting for him to choose us."

"And he never did."

"No. He never did." I looked at the stars instead of at her. "That's why I can't be like him. Why I have to stay even when it's hard. Because I know what it feels like to be left, and I won't do that to someone I—" I stopped, the words catching in my throat.

"Someone you what?"

I looked at her then, this beautiful, impossible girl who'd crashed into my life and refused to leave even when I'd given her every reason to run. Who saw past my last name to who I actually was. Who made me want to be better, braver, more than what the town had decided I could be.

"Someone I care about," I finished, though the words felt inadequate for what I actually felt.

Elizabeth's eyes were bright in the starlight. "I care about you too. More than I should. More than is smart or safe or any of the things a proper mayor's daughter is supposed to feel."

"We're quite a pair."

"The worst pair. Most impossible pair." She leaned closer. "And I wouldn't change it."

I kissed her, slow and careful, and it felt different than before. Deeper. More real. Like we were crossing some line we hadn't quite crossed yet, admitting something we'd been dancing around since that first day she walked into the garage.

When we pulled apart, Elizabeth rested her head on my shoulder.

"Jake?"

"Yeah?"

"What happens when summer ends? When I go to college?"

The question I'd been avoiding. The reality we'd been pretending didn't exist. In a month, Elizabeth would leave for Purdue. She'd be gone all semester, living in a dorm, meeting new people, having experiences I couldn't be part of. And I'd be here, at the garage, in the same place I'd always been.

"I don't know," I admitted.

"We're only an hour apart. Purdue's in Lafayette. You could visit. Or I could come home on weekends."

"Your father would notice."

"So I'll tell him I'm visiting Linda. Or the library. Or studying with classmates."

"More lies."

"I'm already lying to him every time I say I'm going for a drive and meet you here instead. What's a few more?" Her voice was fierce. "I'm not giving you up just because summer ends, Jake. That's not happening."

"What about when you meet someone there? Someone your father would approve of, someone who could give you the life you deserve—"

"Stop." She sat up to look at me. "Stop deciding for me what I deserve or what I'll want. You did that once and it nearly ended us. Don't do it again."

"I'm just being realistic—"

"You're being scared. There's a difference." She cupped my face in her hands. "I don't want someone my father approves of. I want you. Stubborn, scared, brilliant you who thinks he's not good enough but is better than he knows."

"Elizabeth—"

"Promise me you won't run. That when summer ends and I go to college and everything gets harder, you won't decide I'm better off without you and disappear."

I thought about Shane riding away into the mountains. About my father walking out that door and never coming back. About all the ways people left when things got difficult.

And I thought about Elizabeth's hand in mine, her belief that I was worth staying for, her refusal to give up on us even when I'd tried to give up myself.

"I promise," I said. "I won't run."

"Good." She kissed me again, quick and sweet. "Because you're stuck with me, Jake Cooper. For as long as you'll have me."

For as long as I'll have her. Like I was the one doing the choosing, the one with options, the one who might walk away. Like she didn't realize I was already gone for her in ways that terrified me.

"Forever then," I said, trying to make it sound light. Joking.

But Elizabeth smiled like I'd said something serious. Something true.

"Forever," she agreed.

We stayed at the quarry until the stars filled the sky, bright and countless and eternal. And for the first time since this started, I let myself believe that maybe we really could find a way. That maybe impossible wasn't the same as doomed.

That maybe forever was something we could actually have.
