# Chapter 3: Just a Car

The Buick's fuel pump had failed. Simple diagnosis, straightforward repair. I'd seen it a hundred times—the distinctive whine of a dying pump, the engine's hesitation as it struggled for fuel.

Except this wasn't just any car. This was Mayor Hayes's 1955 Special, and every bolt I turned carried weight beyond usual work.

If I screwed this up, it wouldn't be "the mechanic made a mistake." It'd be "Roy Cooper's kid couldn't even fix a simple fuel pump." Sam would lose the mayor's business, and one more door would close in a town that didn't have many open for people like me.

So I was careful. More careful than the job required. Careful was better than giving them ammunition.

I'd pulled the old pump the day before, laid out all the components on my workbench like a surgery. The diaphragm was shot, rubber cracked and brittle from age and Indiana heat. The valves were gummed up with sediment. The whole assembly needed replacing, which meant ordering the part from Indianapolis and waiting two days for delivery.

When the new pump arrived, I installed it with the kind of precision Sam had taught me—torque specs exact, gaskets properly sealed, fuel lines checked twice. I bled the system, tested the pressure, ran the engine until I was satisfied it purred like it should.

Then I did something I didn't have to do. I washed the car.

Sam didn't charge for washing. But the Buick had accumulated two days of garage dust, and I found myself pulling it to the wash area, unreeling the hose, grabbing soap.

I told myself it was good for business. Smart practice.

But mostly I just didn't want Elizabeth Hayes to pick up her father's car dusty and streaked, didn't want her thinking we didn't care.

Which was stupid. It was just a car, and what she thought shouldn't matter to me at all.

I washed it anyway.

The afternoon sun beat down as I worked, soap suds sliding down chrome, water beading on waxed paint. The Buick was nice—cream and chrome, solid American engineering. Not that I'd ever own one. My Indian was worth ten of these to me. But I could appreciate the craftsmanship anyway.

I was buffing the chrome when I heard the footsteps.

Light. Careful. The click of heels I'd been half-listening for since I'd started washing the damn car.

I straightened, tossed the buffing cloth onto the workbench, and turned around.

Elizabeth Hayes stood at the edge of the wash area, sunlight catching her hair, her yellow dress bright against the garage gray. She looked like something from a magazine advertisement.

She smiled, and I felt that same stupid stutter in my chest.

"Hello, Jake."

She remembered my name. Of course she remembered—it'd only been two days. But hearing her say it again did something to my carefully constructed defenses.

"Miss Hayes." I wiped my hands on my coveralls, aware of the water soaking my t-shirt, the soap probably in my hair. "Car's ready."

"I can see that." She walked closer, and I caught that same light perfume cutting through the smell of soap and water. "You washed it."

"Yeah. Well. It was dusty."

"You didn't have to do that."

"I know."

She looked at the Buick, then at me, something unreadable in those blue-gray eyes. "Thank you."

"Just part of the job." The lie came easy, automatic. "Let me grab the keys and the invoice. Sam's got everything in the office."

"Wait." She took another step closer, and I realized we were standing in the wash area, just the two of us, no Sam as buffer. "Can you tell me what was wrong? I'd like to understand."

I should've just given her the simple version. "Fuel pump failed, we replaced it, good as new." That's what most customers wanted—the reassurance that it was fixed, not the details of how.

But Elizabeth was looking at me with genuine interest, and I heard myself saying, "Fuel pump. It's what moves gasoline from the tank to the carburetor. When it fails, engine can't get fuel, can't run."

"How did it fail?"

I grabbed the old pump from the workbench where I'd left it, held it out so she could see. "Diaphragm inside cracked. See here?" I pointed to the damaged rubber. "This flexes to create suction, pulls fuel through the system. When it cracks, it can't maintain pressure."

Elizabeth leaned in to look, close enough that I could count the lashes framing her eyes if I'd been fool enough to try. She studied the pump seriously, like it was important, like understanding this mattered.

"And that's what these cars need? This constant suction to pull the fuel?"

"Yeah. Gravity won't do it—tank's lower than the engine. Needs mechanical help."

"So the engine creates the suction? Or is it separate?"

Nobody asked me questions like this. Nobody cared about the mechanics once the car ran again. But Elizabeth was watching me like my answer was important, and I found myself explaining more than I intended.

"Pump's mechanical, runs off the engine's camshaft. This lobe here—" I pointed to the component, "—pushes this arm, which compresses the diaphragm, creates the pumping action. Elegant system, really. Uses the engine's motion to feed itself."

"That is elegant." She looked up at me, and we were standing too close, the old fuel pump between us like some kind of weird offering. "You really understand this. How it all works together."

I shrugged, uncomfortable with the admiration in her voice. "It's just mechanics."

"It's not 'just' anything. Most people couldn't explain this. They just expect it to work and get angry when it doesn't." She smiled. "You know how things fit together. That's a gift."

A gift. Like being good with engines was something special instead of just the only thing I'd ever been good at. I set the old pump back on the workbench, needed the distance.

"New pump's in, pressure tested, should run fine now. Better than before, probably."

"How much do I owe you?"

"Sam's got the invoice. I'll grab it."

I started toward the office, and she followed, her heels clicking on the concrete. Sam was on the phone with a parts supplier, looked up when we entered, and covered the receiver.

"Miss Hayes. Car ready?"

"Jake explained everything," Elizabeth said. "The fuel pump and how it works. Very thorough."

Sam's eyebrows rose slightly, and I concentrated very hard on finding the invoice in the filing system that made sense only to Sam and God.

"Jake knows his stuff," Sam said, pride sneaking into his gruff voice despite himself. "Best diagnostic eye I've seen in thirty years."

I found the invoice, handed it to Elizabeth before Sam could embarrass me further. She looked at the total, pulled cash from a small purse that probably cost more than I made in a week.

"This seems very reasonable."

"Fair price for fair work," Sam said. "Your father's car should run smooth now. Any problems, you bring it right back."

"I will. Thank you, Mr. Henderson." She counted out the bills, handed them to Sam, then turned to me. "And thank you, Jake. For the repair and the explanation. I appreciate you taking the time."

"Just doing my job."

"You did it well."

The words shouldn't have mattered. Just politeness, the kind of thing well-brought-up girls said to service workers. Thank you, good job, have a nice day. Empty phrases that meant nothing.

But the way Elizabeth said it, looking straight at me like she meant every word, it didn't feel empty.

Sam went back to his phone call, and I walked Elizabeth out to the Buick. The keys felt heavy in my palm when I handed them over, and our fingers brushed for half a second—her skin soft, mine rough with calluses and old scars.

She didn't pull away like I was contagious.

"I hope it runs well for you," I said, because I had to say something.

"I'm sure it will." She opened the driver's door, paused. "Jake?"

"Yeah?"

"Do you ever work on other cars? Besides repairs, I mean. Do you ever build things? Customize them?"

The question caught me off-guard. "Sometimes. Why?"

"I have a 1953 Chevrolet. It runs fine, but I don't really understand it. How to maintain it, what to listen for, when something's wrong versus just normal." She met my eyes, and I couldn't look away. "Do you think you could teach me? The basics, at least. I'd pay you, of course."

My brain was screaming warnings. This was dangerous territory. The mayor's daughter asking me to give her private lessons, spend time alone with her. This was how reputations got destroyed—hers and mine both, though mine didn't have far to fall.

I should say no. Make an excuse. Tell her Sam could recommend someone more appropriate.

"Yeah," I heard myself say instead. "I could do that."

Her smile was bright enough to hurt. "Really?"

"Basic maintenance isn't complicated. Check your oil, your tire pressure, look for leaks. Stuff every driver should know."

"When?"

"Bring the car by on Saturday. Morning, before we get busy. I can show you a few things."

"Saturday morning. I'll be here." She slid into the driver's seat, and I stepped back so she could close the door. The engine started smooth and strong, the new fuel pump doing its job like it was supposed to.

Elizabeth rolled down the window. "Thank you, Jake. Really."

"See you Saturday."

She pulled out of the garage, and I watched the Buick disappear down the street toward Elm and the tree-lined respectability where she lived. Watched until I couldn't see it anymore, until the sound of the engine faded into the general noise of Millbrook on a Thursday afternoon.

What the hell had I just agreed to?

I turned back to the garage, and Sam was standing in the bay door, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

"That girl's the mayor's daughter," he said. Not a question.

"I know."

"And you just agreed to give her private lessons."

"Basic maintenance. That's all."

Sam studied me long enough that I had to work not to squirm. "Be careful, Jake. Girl like that, world like hers—it's not for guys like us. You get too close, you'll get burned."

"I know that too."

"Knowing and remembering are different things." He shook his head, turned back toward the garage. "Just be careful."

I stood there in the summer heat, hands still damp from washing a car I didn't have to wash, waiting for a girl I shouldn't be waiting for.

Sam was right. I knew that.

But Saturday suddenly seemed very far away.
