# Chapter 21: The Ultimatum

The black sedan pulls up just after three on Thursday. I'm replacing spark plugs when I see it through the bay door—expensive, polished, out of place.

Mayor Hayes steps out.

My stomach drops. I've seen him from a distance, but never this close. Never had him looking at me with eyes that could freeze hell over.

Dark suit despite the heat, tall, broad-shouldered—the kind of presence that makes you stand up straighter. His face is hard, jaw set, barely controlled anger radiating off him.

Sam comes out of the office, wiping his hands. "Can I help you, Mayor?"

"I'm here to speak with Jake Cooper." His voice is cultured, controlled. The voice of a man used to being listened to.

"About what?" Sam's protective, moving to stand between us.

"Private business."

"Jake's on my time right now."

"This will only take a few minutes." Mayor Hayes's eyes find mine over Sam's shoulder. "Unless he'd prefer I make it public business instead."

The threat's clear. I set down my wrench, wipe my hands on my rag. "It's fine, Sam. I'll talk to him."

Sam doesn't like it but steps aside. "My office. I'll be right outside."

I follow him into Sam's cramped office. Barely big enough for a desk and two chairs. Walls covered with calendars and parts catalogues. Mayor Hayes looks completely out of place.

He doesn't sit. Neither do I. We stand on opposite sides of the desk, and I'm aware of how I must look—work clothes, grease-stained hands, bruised face. Everything I am against everything he represents.

"Mr. Cooper." His voice is cold. Formal. "I'll be direct. I want you to stay away from my daughter."

No preamble. No politeness. Just straight to it.

"With all due respect, sir—"

"I'm not asking for your respect. I'm stating a fact." He leans forward slightly, hands on the desk. "You are to have no contact with Elizabeth. No meetings, no conversations, no acknowledgment if you pass on the street. Nothing. Do I make myself clear?"

My fists clench at my sides. "Elizabeth's old enough to make her own choices."

"Elizabeth is seventeen and incapable of seeing past infatuation to reality."

"And what do I represent?"

His eyes are ice. "Trouble. A poor future. A step down. You're Roy Cooper's son, and in this town, that means something. Drunk father, abandoned family, no prospects. Fights in alleys over debts you can't pay. Pulling down anyone foolish enough to attach themselves to you."

Every word lands like a punch. Accurate. Brutal.

"I'm not my father."

"Aren't you?" He straightens, looks at me with something like pity. "I heard about your altercation with Danny Walsh. Beaten up behind a garage over your father's debts. Tell me, Mr. Cooper, how is that different from what Roy would have done?"

"I didn't make those debts."

"But you're paying for them. And if my daughter insists on this relationship, she'll pay too. With her reputation, her future, her safety."

"I would never—"

"You already have. She's been seen with you publicly. The gossip is damaging her standing. College recommendations. My political position. All because she thinks she's in love with you."

"She is—" I stop. Can't claim something that feels like theft.

"She's seventeen. She doesn't understand what love requires. Financial security. Social stability. A partner who can provide for her. Can you offer any of that?"

"Not yet. But I'm working—"

"Working where? Here?" He glances around the shabby office with barely concealed disdain. "Making what, forty dollars a week? Living in a rental house on the east side? That's not a future, Mr. Cooper. That's survival. And it's not what my daughter deserves."

My throat's tight. Everything he's saying is true. Every word a reminder of exactly how far below Elizabeth I am.

"What do you want from me?"

"I want you to disappear from her life." He pulls out a card, sets it on the desk. "There's a mechanic position in Gary, Indiana. Fifty miles away. Better pay. Take it and leave Millbrook, I'll give you a good recommendation."

I stare at the card. A bribe. Leave town, leave Elizabeth, get a better job.

"And if I don't?"

His expression hardens. "Then I'll make your life difficult. Sam's Garage operates on a license I can have reviewed. Inspections ordered. Codes enforced. I doubt this place meets every regulation."

My blood goes cold. "Sam has nothing to do with this."

"Sam employed you knowing you're trouble. Danny Walsh came here looking for you. Who's to say what other violence might follow?"

"You'd destroy Sam's business because I won't leave your daughter alone?"

"I'd protect every business and citizen in this town, which includes steering them clear of known trouble." He picks up the card, holds it out. "This is simple, Mr. Cooper. Take the job. Leave town. Let Elizabeth get on with her life. Or stay and watch everything around you crumble. Sam's business. Your employment prospects anywhere in this county. Perhaps your mother's employment as well—I believe she works at Miller's Diner?"

The threat to my mother makes my vision go red. "You leave her out of this."

"Then we understand each other." He sets the card back down. "Two choices. Leave voluntarily with a better opportunity, or stay and face consequences you can't afford."

"This is blackmail."

"This is pragmatism. You have nothing to offer my daughter but hardship. I'm giving you a way out. You get a better job. Elizabeth moves forward. Everyone wins."

"Except I lose Elizabeth."

"You never had her. Not really." His voice is almost gentle, which makes it worse. "Young men like you don't end up with girls like my daughter. That's reality. The sooner you accept it, the easier this becomes."

I want to argue. Want to tell him he's wrong, that Elizabeth and I can make this work, that love matters more than money or status or any of the things he's talking about. But looking at this man—powerful, connected, absolutely certain of his position—I can't make the words come.

Because he's not wrong. About any of it.

"If you actually care about her," Mayor Hayes says quietly, "you'll do what's best for her future. Not what feels good in the moment."

"You mean leave."

"I mean let her have the life she's meant to have. Not drag her down to your level out of selfishness."

Selfish. That's what it is, isn't it? Keeping her when I can't give her anything. When being with me costs her everything. When her own father has to come to a garage to threaten me just to protect her future.

"I love her," I say. The words come out rough.

"Then prove it." He straightens, adjusts his jacket. "The position in Gary starts Monday. You have until then to decide. Choose wisely, Mr. Cooper. For everyone's sake."

He walks out, leaving the card on Sam's desk. I hear the office door close, hear him exchange brief words with Sam, hear his car start and drive away.

Then it's just me and that card and the weight of impossible choices.

Sam comes in a minute later. "What'd he want?"

"To make sure I know my place."

Sam picks up the card, reads it. "Gary, huh?"

"He wants me gone."

"What do you want?"

"Doesn't matter." I slump into the chair. "Matters what's right."

"Those ain't always different."

"They are this time." I look at Sam. "He's right. I got nothing to offer her. I'm dragging her down. What does that make me?"

"Makes you a kid in a hard situation."

"Makes me exactly what the town thinks."

Sam's quiet for a minute. "You know, when Roy worked here—before you were born—he had that same look sometimes. Like the world was against him and he might as well live down to expectations."

"I'm not—"

"You're not him. I know that. Question is, do you?"

I don't know how to answer that. Because sitting here after Mayor Hayes laid out exactly how powerless I am, exactly how much trouble I cause just by existing, I'm not sure anymore what the difference is between me and my father.

Roy ran from his problems. I'm being told to run from mine—away from Elizabeth, away from Millbrook, away from everything that might pull me toward being better.

And the hell of it is, leaving might actually be the right thing to do.

"He threatened your business," I say. "Said he'd have inspections, code enforcement, make trouble for you."

Sam waves a hand. "Let him try. This garage is clean."

"But if it wasn't—if there's any violation he could use—"

"Jake." Sam's voice is firm. "Don't make decisions based on protecting me. I can handle Richard Hayes."

"Can you? He's the mayor. He's got connections, power. He could—"

"He could do a lot of things. Doesn't mean he will, or that I'd let him." Sam sits on the edge of his desk. "Question you gotta answer isn't about me or about what Hayes wants. It's about what you want. And whether you're willing to fight for it."

"Fighting might mean you lose everything."

"Might. Or might not." He shrugs. "But giving up guarantees you lose. That's just math."

I look at the card again. A job in Gary. Fifty miles away. Better pay. A fresh start where nobody knows I'm Roy Cooper's son.

Sounds like freedom. Looks like cowardice.

"He said if I actually cared about her, I'd do what's best for her future."

"And you think leaving is that?"

"I think staying costs her everything. Her reputation, her father's approval, maybe college. All for what? A guy who works in a garage and can't protect her from his own father's debts?"

"That what Elizabeth thinks?"

"Elizabeth doesn't see it clearly. She's—" I search for words. "She sees what she wants to see. Who she wants me to be. Not who I actually am."

"And who are you?"

The question hits hard. Who am I? Roy Cooper's son? The guy from the wrong side? The mechanic with no prospects? The boyfriend who brings trouble wherever he goes?

Or the guy Elizabeth sees when she looks at me? The one worth fighting for, worth believing in, worth risking everything for?

I don't know anymore.

"I should get back to work," I say, standing.

Sam doesn't stop me, just watches as I walk out of the office back to Henderson's Ford and spark plugs that need changing. Simple, mechanical work that doesn't require answers to impossible questions.

But the card stays on Sam's desk. And Monday's deadline keeps ticking closer.

Two choices. Leave or stay. Run or fight.

And for the first time since Elizabeth walked into this garage, I'm not sure which is the right answer anymore.
