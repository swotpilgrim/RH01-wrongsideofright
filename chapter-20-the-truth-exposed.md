# Chapter 20: The Truth Exposed

Elizabeth's already moving to her car, returning with a canteen and her pale blue cardigan. Without hesitating, she tears a strip off the bottom.

"You're ruining your—"

"I don't care." She dampens the fabric, kneels in front of me. "Hold still."

She dabs at the cut on my lip and I hiss. The water's cold, her touch gentle. I watch her face—concentrated, worried. Mayor's daughter shouldn't be kneeling in the dirt cleaning blood off a guy like me.

"This is humiliating," I mutter.

"What is?"

"You having to see me like this. Beaten up."

Her hand stills. "You're not useless."

"I couldn't even defend myself."

"Three on one and you survived. That's smart." She tears another strip, dampens it. "Turn your head. You've got blood on your temple."

I turn, let her clean the dried blood. Her fingers are soft, careful. Each touch reminds me how wrong this is—her softness against my violence.

"There." She sits back, surveys her work. "It's not perfect, but at least you're not bleeding anymore."

I look down at her hands. My blood stains her fingers, dark against her pale skin. Her ruined sweater lies beside her, strips torn off, soaked red in places. This. This is what I bring into her life. Blood and violence and ruin.

"Thank you," I manage.

"Don't thank me." She balls up the bloody strips, sets them aside. "Just tell me the truth. All of it."

So I do. Tell her about Danny and his father, about Roy's debt. About how debts get inherited in my world. About the beating being the first installment.

"This is what happens when you're Roy Cooper's kid," I finish. "The past never lets go. I'm still his son. Still responsible for everything he did."

Elizabeth's quiet for a minute, staring at her stained hands. Then: "That's not how it works."

"That's exactly how it works."

"No. That's how Danny Walsh thinks it works. But that's not the truth."

"What's the truth then?"

"You're not your father. You didn't make those debts. You shouldn't have to pay for them."

"But I do." I gesture to my bruised face. "Whether I should or not."

"Then we'll find a way to fix it."

"There's no 'we' about this. This is my problem."

"Your problems are my problems."

"They shouldn't be." I stand, ribs protesting. "Don't you see? This is what your father meant. The violence of my world bleeding into yours. You're sitting here with my blood on your hands."

"You didn't drag me anywhere. I chose to be here."

"You chose before you knew what it meant." I step closer, make her look at me—really look at my bruised face, my split lip, the evidence of what being with me costs. "This is what it means, Elizabeth. Not romantic nights at the quarry or stolen kisses at the garage. This. Violence and debt and danger. This is my world."

"Then I'll learn to live in it."

"No." The word comes out harder than I meant. "You won't. You shouldn't have to."

"That's not your decision to make."

"Yeah, it is." I look at her standing there in her nice dress, her ruined sweater at her feet, my blood on her hands. Mayor's daughter trying to save the wrong-side kid from himself. The impossibility of it hits me fresh. "Your father was right about me. About all of it."

"Jake—"

"He said I'd drag you down. That my world is dangerous. Look around, Elizabeth. He was right."

"One bad thing happened—"

"It's my whole life. My father's debts, his reputation, the fights, the poverty—that's permanent. Being with me means you inherit all of it."

"I don't care."

"You should." I take her hand, turn it so she can see my blood staining her palm. "Look. This is what I bring to your life. Blood and trouble and pain. Your father sees it. The whole town sees it. When are you gonna see it?"

Her chin lifts. "I see someone who got hurt over a debt that isn't his. I see someone being incredibly stupid because he thinks I can't handle reality."

"Can you?" I challenge. "Danny's coming back in two weeks. If I don't have the money he's gonna beat me again. And again. Until I either pay up or—" I don't finish.

"Then we'll figure out how to get the money."

"There's no 'we,' Elizabeth. This is my fight."

"Stop saying that." She pulls her hand from mine, and I can see tears starting again. "Stop trying to push me away because you think I'm too delicate or too good or too whatever. I'm here. I chose to be here. And I'm not going anywhere just because things got difficult."

"This isn't difficult. Difficult is a hard test or a fight with your father. This is dangerous. This is the kind of thing that ruins lives."

"Then we'll face it together."

God, she's stubborn. Stubborn and brave and completely unwilling to see what's right in front of her. I'm poison. Everything I touch turns bad. My father proved that, and now I'm proving it all over again by letting her stand here covered in my blood.

"I can't do this," I say quietly.

"Can't do what?"

"Can't watch you ruin your life for me." I meet her eyes. "Your father offered you everything—college, respectability, a good future. All you gotta do is walk away from me. And you should. You should take what he's offering and run as far away from me as you can."

"I don't want that future if you're not in it."

"You say that now. But what about next month when Danny comes back? What about six months from now when some other ghost from my father's past shows up wanting something? What about a year from now when you look around and realize you gave up everything for a guy who can't give you anything back?"

"You give me everything that matters."

"I give you trouble."

"You give me honesty. And realness. And someone who sees me for who I am, not who I'm supposed to be." Her voice breaks. "Don't take that away because you're scared."

"I'm not scared." But I am. Terrified. Of her getting hurt because of me. Of failing her the way my father failed my mother. Of becoming exactly what everyone expects me to be.

"You are." She steps closer, puts her hand on my chest right over my heart. "You're scared of becoming your father. Of hurting me the way he hurt your mother. But Jake, you're not him. Can't you see that?"

"How do you know?" The question comes out raw. "How do you know I won't turn into him? Everyone says I will. The whole town's been waiting for it. Maybe they're right."

"Because I know you." Her hand's still on my chest, steady. "I've watched you work yourself to exhaustion at that garage. I've seen how you take care of your mother, how loyal you are to your friends, how you show up every day and do the work even when it's hard. Your father ran. You stay. That's the difference."

"Staying isn't enough."

"It's everything." Her voice is absolute. "Don't you understand? You're already not him. You've already made different choices. And you'll keep making different choices because that's who you are."

I want to believe her. Want to believe I'm not doomed to repeat my father's mistakes, that loving her won't destroy us both. But looking at her ruined sweater, her stained hands, her tear-streaked face—all because of me, because of my life—I can't make myself believe it.

"You should go home," I say.

"Jake—"

"Please." The word comes out rough. "Just go home. Tell your father you're done with me. Move on with your life. Forget about the wrong-side kid who was stupid enough to think he could be with someone like you."

"I'm not forgetting anything."

"Elizabeth—"

"No." She's crying again but her voice is steel. "I know what you're doing. You're trying to push me away because you think it's noble or protective or whatever. But it's not. It's just scared. And I'm not letting you do it."

"You don't get a say."

"The hell I don't." She grabs my shirt, pulls me closer even though it must hurt my ribs. "You told me you loved me. Was that a lie?"

"No. But—"

"Then trust me." Her eyes are locked on mine. "Trust that I know what I'm choosing. Trust that I'm strong enough to handle this. Trust that maybe—just maybe—love is enough to build on."

"Love doesn't pay debts." The practical side of me that sounds like Sam. "It doesn't stop guys like Danny. It doesn't change where I'm from or what people think of me."

"No. But it gives us a reason to figure it out anyway."

I close my eyes. She's not making this easy. Not letting me do the right thing and walk away. Not letting me protect her from myself.

"I'm gonna disappoint you," I say quietly. "Eventually. I'm gonna fail or mess up or become exactly what everyone thinks I am. And you're gonna wish you'd listened to your father."

"Then I'll deal with that when it happens." She touches my face, makes me open my eyes. "But right now, in this moment, I love you. And I'm asking you to let me stay. Can you do that?"

Can I? Can I be selfish enough to keep her when I know I should let her go? Can I let her risk everything on someone as broken as me?

I look at her—beautiful even crying, brave even scared, choosing me even when everyone's telling her not to. And I'm not strong enough to walk away.

"Yeah," I whisper. "I can do that."

She kisses me then, soft and careful because of my split lip. Tastes like tears and determination. When she pulls back, she's almost smiling.

"Good. Because you're stuck with me now, Jake Cooper. For better or worse."

"Mostly worse," I mutter, but I'm pulling her closer, careful of my ribs.

"We'll see." She rests her head against my shoulder. "We'll see."

We stand there at the quarry while darkness settles in complete, her in my arms, both of us marked by my blood and her tears. I should feel victorious—she's staying, choosing me despite everything. But all I feel is dread.

Because Danny's still coming back. Her father's still against us. The town's still watching. And I still don't have any idea how to fix any of it.

But Elizabeth's here, solid and real in my arms. And for tonight, that's gonna have to be enough.
