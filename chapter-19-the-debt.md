# Chapter 19: The Debt

Danny Walsh walks into Sam's Garage at three o'clock on Wednesday like he owns the place.

I'm under Mrs. Henderson's Chrysler when I hear boots on concrete. Heavier than Sam's walk. When I roll out, Danny Walsh is standing there with a cigarette and a look that makes my stomach drop.

"Jake Cooper. Been looking for you."

I stand slow, wipe my hands. Danny's maybe twenty-four, with slicked-back hair and a scar through his eyebrow. He runs with a rough crowd—guys who make money in ways nobody asks about.

"Yeah?" I keep my voice neutral. "What for?"

"Got a debt needs settling." He flicks ash on Sam's clean floor. "Your old man borrowed money from my father five years back. Never paid it back before he split."

Of course. Everything bad traces back to Roy.

"That's not my debt," I say.

"Your father's debt is your debt. Family obligation."

"My father walked out ten years ago. Whatever he owed, that's on him."

"Roy's son inherits Roy's obligations. Two hundred plus interest. Call it three hundred now."

Three hundred dollars. Four months of wages.

"I don't have that kind of money."

"Then you better find it." Danny drops the cigarette, grinds it out with his boot heel. "You got two weeks."

"Or what?"

His smile gets colder. "Or I'll have to teach you about consequences. And trust me, Cooper, you don't want that lesson."

"Everything alright back here?" Sam's voice cuts through the tension. He's coming through from the office, wiping his hands on a rag, his eyes sharp on Danny.

"Just having a conversation with young Jake here." Danny's posture shifts slightly, but he doesn't back down. "About family business."

"Looks to me like you're done with your conversation." Sam moves to stand beside me. He's got a good thirty years on Danny but there's steel in his voice. "So unless you got car trouble, I think it's time you moved along."

Danny looks between us. For a second I think he's gonna push it, but then he laughs. "Sure, old man. I'm leaving." He looks at me. "Two weeks, Cooper. Don't make me come find you."

He walks out, and the tension doesn't leave with him. Sits in the garage like oil smoke.

"What was that about?" Sam asks.

"Nothing. Just—" I can't make myself say it. Can't admit that even gone, my father's still ruining my life. "Nothing I can't handle."

Sam gives me a look that says he doesn't believe me, but he doesn't push. "That Walsh kid's trouble. You steer clear of him, you hear?"

"Yeah." Like I have a choice.

I try to focus on work, but Danny's threat sits in my gut like a rock. Three hundred dollars. Two weeks. No way to get that kind of money.

Or maybe I just take the beating that's coming.

Sam locks up at six. I tell him I'm gonna finish cleaning up. He gives me a look but leaves, and I'm alone with my anger.

I'm out back dumping oil pans when I hear boots on gravel.

"Didn't think you'd actually be stupid enough to stick around."

I turn. Danny's back with two guys flanking him.

"Danny. I don't have the money."

"I know. That's why we're here. You pay another way. Consider this the first installment."

I back up but there's nowhere to go. Three on one.

"You don't gotta do this."

"Yeah, I do. Gotta send a message."

The first punch catches me in the jaw, snaps my head back. I taste blood. Then they're all on me and it's just pain and survival.

I land a few hits but there's three of them. Someone kicks my legs out. I hit the gravel hard, boots finding my ribs, my back.

I curl up, protect my head, ride it out.

Danny calls them off. "That's enough. For now."

I stay down, breathing hard. Ribs screaming, jaw throbbing, split lip.

"Two weeks," Danny says above me. "You got two weeks to come up with the money, Cooper. Next time won't be so gentle."

Boots on gravel. Engine starting. Taillights disappearing.

I lie there waiting for the world to stop spinning. Then force myself up. Everything hurts but nothing's broken.

I make it to my motorcycle and get it started. The ride to the quarry is agony, every bump shooting pain through my ribs. But Elizabeth's waiting.

The quarry's dark when I arrive, lit only by stars and a sliver of moon. Elizabeth's car is already there. She's sitting on the limestone edge and stands up when she hears my motorcycle.

"Jake! You're late, I was starting to—" She stops. Even in the darkness she can see something's wrong. "Oh my God. Jake, what happened?"

I kill the engine. "It's nothing. Just—"

"That's not nothing." She's running toward me. "Your face—you're bleeding. Who did this?"

"Doesn't matter."

"It absolutely matters. Jake, you need a doctor."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine." She takes my arm carefully. "Sit down before you fall down."

I let her lead me to the limestone edge. When I sit, something in my ribs shifts and I can't hide the wince.

"Tell me what happened," she says. Her voice is shaking.

So I tell her. About Danny, my father's debt, owing three hundred dollars I don't have. About the beating.

She listens with her hand over her mouth, tears tracking down her face. "Your father did this."

"No. Danny Walsh did this."

"Because of your father. A debt you don't even owe." Her voice breaks. "This isn't fair."

"Welcome to my world." The bitterness in my voice surprises even me. "This is what it means to be Roy Cooper's kid. His debts, his reputation, his mistakes—they're all mine whether I want them or not."

"Jake—"

"You see now?" I look at her crying. "This is my world. What being with me means. Your father's right about everything."

"No. This isn't you. This is what was done to you. There's a difference."

"Is there?" I laugh but it hurts. "I'm the guy who gets beaten up for debts he didn't make. Who's got nothing and no way out."

"You have me."

"Do I?" The words come out harsher than I meant. "You think your father's gonna let you anywhere near me after this? When the town hears Jake Cooper got beat up over his deadbeat dad's debts? When they're reminded exactly what kind of family I come from?"

She's crying harder now, and I hate myself for it, but I can't stop. Can't stop the words that have been building since Danny walked into the garage.

"You shouldn't be here," I say. "You should be home in your nice house with your respectable father, planning your respectable future. Not sitting at a quarry with a guy who just got his ass kicked and probably deserves it."

"Don't say that."

"It's true."

"It's not." She reaches for my hand, and I let her take it even though I shouldn't. Even though her fingers are soft and clean and mine are bloody and bruised. "None of this is your fault, Jake. Not the debt, not the beating, not your father leaving. None of it."

"But I'm the one paying for it."

"That's not fair."

"No. It's not." I look at her—mayor's daughter with tears on her face, holding the hand of a guy who just got beaten in an alley. "And that's exactly why you need to stay away from me. Because my life isn't fair, and it never will be. And being with me means your life won't be fair either."

"I don't care about fair." Her grip tightens. "I care about you."

"You shouldn't."

"Too late."

We sit there in silence for a while, her hand in mine, both of us staring at the dark water. Everything hurts—my face, my ribs, my pride, my heart. Especially my heart.

Because she's seeing it now. The reality of what being with me means. The violence, the poverty, the legacy of failure I can't escape. And sooner or later—probably sooner—she's gonna realize her father's right. That love isn't enough. That I'll drag her down if she lets me.

"You should go home," I say finally. "Your father's probably worrying."

"I don't care if he worries."

"Elizabeth—"

"I'm not leaving you like this." She stands up, resolute. "Come on. I'm taking you home. You need ice and bandages and—"

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. Stop saying you're fine." There's steel in her voice now, underneath the tears. "You're hurt and you're scared and you're pushing me away because you think I can't handle seeing this side of your life. But I can. I can handle it, Jake. What I can't handle is you shutting me out."

I look up at her, and she's beautiful even crying, even angry. Maybe especially then.

"My mother's home," I say. "Can't bring you there."

"Then let me help you here." She's already moving to her car. "I have a first aid kit. Sit still."

I sit still. Watch her return with a metal box, watch her kneel beside me and open it with shaking hands. She pulls out gauze and tape, a bottle of something that's probably gonna sting.

"This might hurt," she warns.

"Can't hurt worse than getting hit."

She dabs at the cut on my lip with something that burns, and I hiss through my teeth. "Sorry," she whispers. "I'm sorry."

"Not your fault."

"Not yours either." She's concentrating on cleaning the blood off my face, her touch gentle. "None of this is your fault."

But it is. Because I'm Roy Cooper's son, and in this town, that's all that matters. Not how hard I work or how much I've changed or what I want to be. Just whose blood runs through my veins.

"There," Elizabeth says finally. "It's not perfect, but it's clean at least."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me." She sits back, looks at me with those eyes that see too much. "I'm so sorry this happened to you."

"Not your fault," I say again.

"I know. But I'm still sorry." She touches my cheek carefully, avoiding the bruise. "And I'm not going anywhere. I need you to know that. No matter what happens, no matter what your father did or what Danny Walsh does or what anyone says—I'm not going anywhere."

I want to believe her. God, I want to believe her.

But sitting here bruised and bloody, knowing there's two more weeks of dread before Danny comes back for another payment, knowing the whole town's gonna hear about this and it'll just confirm everything they already think about me—

I'm not sure there's anything left worth staying for.
