# Chapter 6: Teaching Her

Saturday morning came with clouds threatening rain, the Indiana sky heavy and gray. I got to the garage at eight, two hours before Elizabeth was scheduled to arrive, and spent the time pretending I wasn't watching the clock.

I organized tools. Swept the floor. Pulled out the oil drain pan and filter wrench and arranged them on the workbench. All the while telling myself this was just another lesson, just teaching basic maintenance to a customer who wanted to learn.

The lie was getting harder to believe.

At nine-fifty-five, the pale green Chevrolet pulled into the lot. Elizabeth climbed out wearing pants again—dark gray with cuffs, paired with a white blouse. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, flat shoes that looked practical for garage work.

She'd dressed for getting dirty. Something about that made me smile.

"Good morning," she called, grabbing a small bag from the passenger seat. "Am I on time?"

"Right on time." I walked over, nodded at the bag. "What's that?"

"Lunch. I thought—well, I figured if I'm taking up your Saturday morning, the least I could do is bring food." Pink colored her cheeks. "It's just sandwiches. Nothing fancy."

She'd brought lunch. Made sandwiches and packed them to share with me. The gesture felt more intimate than it should.

"You didn't have to do that."

"I wanted to." She set the bag on the workbench, looked at the arranged tools. "What are we learning today?"

"Oil change. How to check your oil level, when to change it, how to do it yourself." I grabbed the Chevrolet's service manual, flipped to the maintenance section. "Every three thousand miles or three months, whichever comes first. Most important regular maintenance you can do."

Elizabeth pulled out her notebook, that same small one she'd brought before, already full of notes from previous lessons. She'd been writing down everything I taught her, keeping track.

"Why is oil so important?" she asked, pen ready.

"Engine's full of metal parts moving against each other at high speed. Oil lubricates them, keeps them from grinding together and destroying themselves. Also carries heat away, keeps things cool, picks up dirt and metal particles." I walked to her Chevrolet, popped the hood. "Without oil, your engine would seize up in minutes. With dirty oil, it'll wear out years too early."

She leaned in beside me, studying the engine like it was a puzzle she wanted to solve. "How do you know when oil's dirty?"

"Check it. Here—" I pulled the dipstick, wiped it on a shop rag, reinserted it and pulled it again. "See? This end shows the oil level between these marks. But look at the color."

Elizabeth leaned closer, shoulder almost touching mine. "It's dark. Almost black."

"Exactly. Fresh oil's amber, almost golden. As it works, it picks up carbon and metal particles, turns dark. When it's this dark, it's time to change it." I held the dipstick so she could see better. "You should check your oil every week. Only takes a minute."

"Every week?"

"Every week. Before you drive somewhere, pop the hood, pull the dipstick, check the level and color. Car holds about five quarts. If it's low, you add oil. If it's dirty, you change it. Simple maintenance that'll save you thousands in engine repairs down the line."

She wrote this down, careful handwriting filling the pages of her notebook. "My father never mentioned checking oil."

"Most people don't bother. Then they wonder why their engines fail." I grabbed the oil drain pan. "Come on. Let's get under the car, I'll show you where everything is."

I'd pulled the Chevrolet over the inspection pit. I grabbed a work light, climbed down, and Elizabeth followed without hesitation.

The pit put us underneath the car. The work light threw shadows across the undercarriage. I pointed to the oil pan.

"Drain plug's here." I touched the bolt. "Remove this, oil drains out. Replace the filter, add fresh oil, check for leaks."

Elizabeth studied everything, memorizing locations.

"Can I try? Actually doing it instead of watching?"

"Yeah. You can try."

I handed her the combination wrench that fit the drain plug. "Oil's hot—engine's been running to warm it up so it drains better. Be careful. Position the drain pan underneath, then loosen the plug. It'll come out fast once you get it loose, so don't lose it in the drain pan."

Elizabeth positioned the pan carefully, then fit the wrench to the drain plug. She pulled, and I could see the effort in her shoulders, the plug stuck tight.

"Harder," I said. "It's tight. You won't break it."

She pulled harder, and the plug broke free with a satisfying crack. Her face lit up with that same pride I'd seen during the valve adjustment, the joy of making something work with her own hands.

"Now unscrew it the rest of the way, but get ready—oil's coming out fast."

She unscrewed it carefully, and as the last threads came free, hot oil gushed out into the drain pan. Elizabeth jerked her hand back just in time, the plug falling into the oil with a splash.

"Oh no! I lost it!"

"It's okay. Everyone does that the first time. That's why I warned you." I grabbed a pair of pliers. "You'll have to fish it out of the hot oil. Here—use these, let the oil drain first."

She waited patiently while the oil drained, a steady stream that slowly became a drip. When it slowed enough, she fished the drain plug out of the pan with the pliers, held it up triumphantly.

"Got it!"

"Good. Now while that's draining, we change the filter." I grabbed the filter wrench, positioned it around the cylindrical filter. "This catches dirt and particles as the oil circulates. Gets clogged over time. Always replace it when you change oil."

I loosened the filter, then let Elizabeth remove it the rest of the way. More oil spilled out—there was always oil in the filter—dripping onto her hands. She didn't flinch, just held the dirty filter carefully until I handed her a pan to set it in.

"Now we put in the new one. But first—" I opened a fresh quart of oil, poured a little onto my finger, rubbed it around the rubber gasket on the new filter. "Oil the gasket. Creates a seal, makes it easier to remove next time."

Elizabeth copied me, oiling the gasket carefully, then threaded the new filter into place. She tightened it hand-tight, the way I showed her, no wrench needed.

"Perfect. Now the drain plug goes back in. Here—" I handed her the plug with a new copper crush washer. "New washer every time. Creates the seal. Thread it in by hand first, make sure it's not cross-threaded."

She did it carefully, fingers working the plug into the threads, making sure it started straight before she used the wrench to tighten it down.

"Not too tight—you'll strip the threads or crack the pan. Firm, not gorilla-tight. There—that's good."

We climbed out of the pit, and I showed her how to add the fresh oil through the filler cap on top of the engine. She poured carefully, stopping every quart to check the dipstick, making sure she didn't overfill.

"Four and a half quarts," I said. "Check it now—should be right between the marks."

She checked it, and the oil level sat perfect, fresh oil golden on the dipstick. Her grin was bright enough to chase away the gray morning clouds.

"I did it. I changed my oil."

"You did. Start her up, let her run for a minute, then we'll check for leaks."

Elizabeth started the engine, and we both watched the undercarriage, looking for drips. Nothing. Clean work, proper seals, no leaks.

"That's a good oil change," I said. "You did it right."

"You taught me well."

Elizabeth looked at her hands—black with oil, grease under her fingernails—and laughed. "I'm a mess."

"You're a mechanic. Same thing." I grabbed the hand cleaner.

We went to the wash sink. She stood beside me, both of us washing up like this was normal.

"My father would have a heart attack if he saw me right now."

"Probably."

"He thinks I'm at Linda's house. Studying."

"You're lying to him?"

"Being vague. If he asks direct questions, I'll tell the truth. But he doesn't ask." She met my eyes. "Do you want me to stop?"

"No. But I don't want you lying for me either."

"I'm not lying for you. I'm doing this for me. This is the first time I've felt capable instead of decorative."

The frustration in her voice was raw.

"Your father wants to protect you."

"His protection feels like a cage. Here, I don't feel caged."

"Okay. We keep going. But if your father asks direct questions, you tell the truth. Deal?"

"Deal."

"Lunch?" Elizabeth grabbed the bag.

We sat on overturned crates. She handed me a sandwich—roast beef on fresh bread.

"This is good," I said.

"Housekeeper made the roast. I just made sandwiches." She took a bite. "What do you read?"

I could've lied. But she looked curious.

"Whatever the library has. Right now The Grapes of Wrath. Before that For Whom the Bell Tolls."

Her eyes lit up. "I love Steinbeck. Have you read East of Eden?"

"Yeah. Twice."

And we were talking about books. About Cathy and Adam and whether people could overcome their circumstances.

Elizabeth talked about books the way she talked about engines—with genuine interest. We argued about character motivations, debated endings. Somewhere in there I forgot she was the mayor's daughter and I was the greaser mechanic.

We were just two people who liked the same books.

When she checked her watch, the morning had disappeared.

"I need to go. Linda will cover for me, but not indefinitely."

She gathered up the wrappers, then paused. "Same time next week?"

"Same time next week."

"Thank you, Jake. For treating me like I'm smart enough to learn."

"You are smart enough."

Her smile made the gray day bright. She climbed into her Chevrolet—running smooth on fresh oil she'd changed herself—and waved before pulling out.

I stood in the empty garage, surrounded by tools and the smell of motor oil, and realized I was in trouble.

Because I wasn't just teaching her about cars anymore.

I was falling for her.

And that was the most dangerous thing I'd ever done.
