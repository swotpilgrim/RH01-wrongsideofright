# Chapter 30: Building Forward

One month later.

The rented garage smells like metal and oil and possibility. It's nothing fancy—concrete floor, peeling paint, flickering overhead light—but it's mine. Twenty dollars a month courtesy of Tommy's cousin.

And in the middle of it, taking shape on a work stand, is the motorcycle.

My motorcycle. The first one I'm building from scratch.

It's not done yet. Just a frame and engine, raw metal waiting to be transformed. But the lines are clean, the angles sharp, and I can see what it'll become. Sleek and fast and beautiful.

Something mine.

"You're staring at it again."

I turn. Elizabeth's in the doorway with two paper bags. Her hair's pulled back, my old work shirt protecting her dress. She's got grease under her nails.

She's never looked more beautiful.

"Can't help it," I say. "Still can't believe it's real."

"It's real." She sets the bags on the makeshift table. "And you need to eat. When's the last meal you had?"

"This morning."

"Two days ago doesn't count." She unpacks the bags. "I brought chicken and potatoes. Your mother said you didn't come home for dinner."

"I was working—"

"I know. But you still have to eat." She fixes me with that look. "Sam said you're working yourself ragged."

She's right. Between shifts at Sam's and nights here, I'm running on fumes. But I can't stop. Not when I've got something to prove.

"Your father's watching," I say. "Waiting for me to fail or give up or prove I'm not serious. I have to show him this is real."

"You've been showing him for a month. He knows you're serious." She hands me a fork. "Eat."

I eat. The food's exactly what I needed. Elizabeth sits beside me on an upturned crate.

"How was the library?"

"Boring. But it's money." She shrugs. "Dad insisted I get a job before college."

Mayor Hayes. Still making rules, still watching. But he hasn't interfered. Hasn't threatened anyone. Just watches and waits for me to mess up.

"He ask about me?"

"Every day. Wants to know if you're still working on the motorcycle. If you're treating me well."

"What do you tell him?"

"That you're working harder than anyone I know. That he should trust my judgment." She leans against me. "He doesn't like it. But he's trying."

That's something at least.

"How's the build going?" Elizabeth asks, looking at the motorcycle frame. "You were working on the engine mounts last time I was here."

"Finished those. Now I'm fabricating the fuel tank." I point to the metal sheets in the corner. "It's slow going. Never done custom fabrication before, just repairs."

"But you're learning."

"Yeah. Sam's been helping. Showing me techniques, telling me when I'm about to do something stupid." I smile. "Which is often."

"But you're doing it." She walks to the frame, runs her hand along the metal. "It's going to be beautiful."

"If I don't screw it up."

"You won't." Such certainty. "When do you think you'll have it done?"

"Four more months maybe? Six if I hit problems."

"And then?"

"Then I start on the second one. Build up a portfolio. Eventually open a real shop." I shrug. "It's going to take years."

"Good things usually do."

I pull her against me. "You know you don't have to keep helping me."

"And I want to be here. Being part of it." She turns to face me. "We're partners, remember?"

Partners. Now it's real. Elizabeth showing up after library shifts to help. Learning tools, reading manuals, making sketches. She's got grease on her hands and looks more at home here than in her father's house.

"I love you," I say.

"I know." She kisses me. "I love you too. Now show me the fuel tank design."

So I show her. Explain the mounting points, the welding, the angle I'm trying to achieve. She asks smart questions. And when we work, she holds the metal steady while I mark measurements.

We work until sunset. Until Elizabeth has to head home. I walk her to her father's Buick and kiss her goodnight.

"Tomorrow?" she asks.

"After my late shift at Sam's."

"I'll be here." She squeezes my hand. "Keep building."

Then she's gone, and I'm alone with my half-built motorcycle.

But it doesn't feel impossible anymore.

The next day Mayor Hayes shows up at Sam's Garage.

My stomach drops. He hasn't been here since July.

Sam sees him, gives me a look. But I shake my head. This is my fight.

Mayor Hayes walks straight to where I'm working. "Mr. Cooper."

"Sir."

"I want to see it. The motorcycle Elizabeth talks about."

This is a test. But he asked.

"I'm off in an hour."

"I'll wait."

He watches me work, silent and judging. I force myself to focus on the job.

When my shift ends, I lead him to the rented garage.

It looks worse with someone else seeing it. Peeling paint. Stained concrete. And my motorcycle—still just pieces, unfinished.

Mayor Hayes walks around it slowly. His face gives nothing away.

"This is it?"

"Yes sir. Four months of work left."

"And then?"

"Then I build the next one. Eventually open a real shop."

He picks up one of my sketches. Studies it. "You drew this?"

"Yes sir. Design for the fuel tank."

"It's good." He sets down the sketch. "Clean lines. You've thought this through."

I blink.

"Elizabeth says you work here every night."

"Yes sir."

"Sixteen hour days."

"Sometimes longer."

"Why?"

"Because I have to prove I'm serious. That I can actually do this."

"And if it fails?"

"Then I figure out something else. But I don't quit."

He's quiet. Then: "I didn't want this for her."

"I know, sir."

"But she chose you." Still trying to understand. "Despite everything."

I wait.

"Sam says you're the hardest worker he's ever trained." The mayor's jaw works. "I'm starting to believe him."

Starting to believe.

"Thank you, sir."

"Don't thank me yet. I'm still watching." His eyes are sharp. "But you've earned this—I won't interfere. As long as you keep working this hard, keep treating my daughter well, I'll stay out of your way."

More than I expected.

"Yes sir. I promise."

He nods. "Finish it. I want to see it when it's done."

Then he leaves, and I'm standing beside my motorcycle trying to process what just happened.

Mayor Hayes believes I might actually pull this off.

Three weeks later, I take Elizabeth to the quarry.

It's early evening, stars appearing over the limestone cliffs. Our place.

I pull out rolled-up papers from my jacket. Detailed sketches—finished designs for three different motorcycle models.

Elizabeth spreads them out, studies them in the fading light. Her eyes widen.

"Jake. These are incredible."

"You think?"

"I know." She looks up. "These are professional quality."

"Sam helped—"

"Jake." She cups my face. "This is going to work. Your business. Your dreams. All of it."

The certainty in her voice makes me believe it too.

"I couldn't do it without you," I say.

"Yes you could. But I'm glad you don't have to." She kisses me. "Partners."

"Partners."

We sit at the quarry edge watching stars appear, talking about the future. Her college plans—state school, close enough for weekends. My timeline for finishing the first motorcycle. The shop I want to open someday. Building a life together.

"Are you scared?" she asks.

"Terrified. Every day."

"Me too."

"Really?"

"I'm certain about us. About you." She leans her head on my shoulder. "I'm scared about everything else. But trying with you is better than not trying at all."

I tighten my arm around her. "I love you."

"I love you too."

We sit until full dark. Until stars are bright overhead and the quarry is shadows and starlight.

On the ride back to town, I take the long way. Through Millbrook streets where everyone knows my name and my father's reputation. Past Sam's Garage where I learned my trade. Past the town square where Elizabeth stood up to her father in front of everyone. Past Miller's Diner where my mother works, still proud of me despite everything.

Past the houses of people who've watched me grow up. Who've judged me, whispered about me, expected me to fail. Some still do. Mrs. Patterson probably always will. But others—Jim from the hardware store who nods when I pass, Tommy's mother who asks how the business is going, even Bobby Miller who stops sneering long enough to look curious about the motorcycle—they're changing their minds.

Slowly. Grudgingly. But changing.

Elizabeth holds on tight, her face pressed against my back, and I can feel her heartbeat against me. Or maybe that's mine. Hard to tell anymore where one of us ends and the other begins.

I ride through town with my head up. Not hiding. Not ashamed. Not Roy Cooper's kid anymore.

Just Jake. Jake Cooper, who works at Sam's Garage and builds custom motorcycles on the side and loves the mayor's daughter. Jake, who's got thirty-seven dollars saved and a half-built dream in a rented garage and a future that's uncertain but possible.

Jake, who's becoming exactly who he's supposed to be.

The future's still uncertain. The motorcycle business might fail—most new businesses do. Mayor Hayes might change his mind the first time I make a mistake. The town might never fully accept us, might always see me as trouble waiting to happen.

But Elizabeth's arms are around me and stars are bright overhead and somewhere in a rented garage my motorcycle is waiting for tomorrow's work. And that feels like enough.

More than enough.

Everything.

I turn down the road toward Elizabeth's house, then past it, heading toward the edge of town where the houses thin out and the road opens up. The engine purrs beneath us, steady and strong. Elizabeth doesn't ask where we're going. Just holds on and trusts me to get us there.

The road ahead is dark, lit only by my headlight and the stars above. Behind us, Millbrook's lights fade. In front of us, just open road and possibility.

I twist the throttle and we surge forward, riding toward a future we're building on our own terms. Together.

And somehow, that's all I need.
