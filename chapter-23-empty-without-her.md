# Chapter 23: Empty Without Her

Work. That's all there is now.

Sam offers me a transmission rebuild. I take it. Tommy asks if I want to grab a beer. I tell him I'm busy. My mother tries to talk over breakfast and I mumble about being late, leave before she can ask what's wrong.

Because if she asks, I'll have to admit I destroyed the best thing in my life on purpose.

The garage is the only place that makes sense. Problems with solutions. Carburetors that need cleaning, brakes that need replacing. Not like people. Not like hearts.

I'm under Johnson's Chevy when Sam's boots appear next to my head.

"You gonna eat lunch?" he asks.

"Not hungry."

"You said that yesterday."

"Still true."

He's quiet for a minute. "Jake. You can't work yourself to death."

"Watch me."

He leaves a sandwich on the workbench. I'll throw it away later. Can't stomach food lately.

Two weeks since I pushed Elizabeth away. Two weeks of waking with her name on my lips. Two weeks of feeling like half of me is missing.

The crate where she used to sit is still in the corner. I should move it but can't. Same with her thermos on the shelf. Evidence of something that used to be real.

Every car that pulls up, I look. Expecting the Buick, expecting her. But she doesn't come. I made sure of that.

Tommy shows up at four with two coffees. Sets one next to me, leans against the workbench.

"You don't gotta babysit me."

"Just figured you could use company."

"I'm fine."

"When's the last time you slept?"

"I sleep."

"When?"

Can't remember. Nights I ride to the quarry, sit where Elizabeth and I used to sit, stare at dark water until the sky lightens. Then shower, work. Repeat.

"You look like hell," Tommy says.

"Thanks."

"I'm serious, Jake. You're gonna make yourself sick."

"I'm fine," I say again, even though we both know it's a lie.

He's quiet for another minute. Then: "You could call her."

"No."

"Why not?"

"Because it's over."

"Is it? Or did you just decide it should be?"

I slide out from under the Chevy, sit up, look at him. "You don't know what you're talking about."

"I know you've been miserable for two weeks. I know you won't eat, won't sleep, work yourself till you can barely stand. I know whatever happened between you two, it's eating you alive."

"It's better this way."

"Better for who?"

"For her."

"You ask her that?"

No. Because I'm a coward who broke her heart with lies and then ran away.

"Leave it alone, Tommy."

He sighs, sets down his coffee. "You're my best friend. Been my best friend since we were kids. And I'm telling you, whatever you think you're doing—protecting her or whatever—it's not working. You're just hurting. Both of you."

"How do you know she's hurting?"

"Because Linda told me. Said Elizabeth's been coming to school looking like she hasn't slept, barely talks to anyone, just goes through the motions. Sound familiar?"

My chest tightens. She's hurting. Because of me. Because I pushed her away to protect her and now she's suffering anyway.

"That's not—I didn't want—"

"I know." Tommy's voice is gentler. "But intentions don't matter much when the result's the same."

He leaves the coffee and goes, and I'm alone again with engines and guilt.

Saturday. A week and a half after the breakup. I have to go into town for parts. Been avoiding Main Street but Sam needs the carburetor kit today and Miller's Hardware is the only place that carries it.

I park two blocks away. Walk with my head down. Get to the hardware store, find the kit, pay Jim who gives me a look but doesn't comment.

I'm walking back when I see her.

Elizabeth. Half a block away with Linda. Pale green dress, hair pulled back. She looks different. Thinner. Tired. The light dimmed.

My feet stop. Just stand there staring while Linda says something and Elizabeth responds, expressionless.

She hasn't seen me yet. I could turn around, duck into an alley, disappear before she notices. Save us both the pain of an awkward encounter.

But I can't move. Can only watch her like she's water and I'm dying of thirst.

Then Linda says something else and Elizabeth laughs. It's small, not like her real laugh, but it's there. She's starting to move on. Starting to be okay without me.

Which is what I wanted. What I told myself was the right thing.

So why does seeing it feel like getting kicked?

She turns her head, scanning the street, and for half a second our eyes meet across the distance. Everything stops. The whole world narrows down to her face, her eyes widening in recognition, the way her smile dies completely.

I turn and walk away. Fast. Before she can call out, before I have to face what I did to her, before the carefully constructed walls I've built around my heart crack completely.

My hands are shaking when I reach my motorcycle. Takes three tries to start it. I head straight for the quarry.

Our quarry. The place that used to feel like ours.

It's empty in the afternoon sun. No one comes here during the day. I park the motorcycle, walk to the limestone edge, sit down where Elizabeth used to sit.

Everything here is a ghost. I can see her everywhere. Sitting beside me with her legs dangling over the edge. Laughing at something I said. Turning to kiss me with stars reflecting in the water behind her. Crying while I cleaned blood off my face. Standing in front of me asking if I loved her.

I told her I didn't. Looked her in the eyes and lied better than I've ever lied in my life.

Was it protection? Or was it cowardice?

Her father gave me an out. Take the job in Gary, leave Millbrook, start fresh. Seems more appealing every day. Leave behind the garage and Tommy and my mother and every place that reminds me of Elizabeth. Maybe in Gary I could sleep again. Maybe I could eat. Maybe I could forget the way she looked at me right before she slapped me—like I'd broken something in her that couldn't be fixed.

But leaving feels like running. And I've spent my whole life trying not to be my father.

So I stay. Work myself to exhaustion. Avoid her. Try to convince myself I did the right thing.

The sun sets. I should go home. My mother will worry if I'm late for dinner again.

But I don't move. Just sit here in the growing dark, alone with my choices and the empty space where Elizabeth used to be.

"You look like someone shot your dog."

I turn. Sam's standing behind me, hands in his pockets, looking like he just happened to be passing by even though the quarry's fifteen minutes out of his way.

"Didn't know you made house calls," I say.

"Your mother's worried. Asked me to check on you." He comes to sit beside me, grunts as his knees protest. "You gonna tell me what happened?"

"Nothing happened."

"Jake. I've known you eight years. I know when you're lying."

I'm quiet for a long time. Then: "I ended it with Elizabeth."

"Figured that much." He lights a cigarette, offers me one. I shake my head. "Want to tell me why?"

"Because her father was right. About all of it. I got nothing to offer her. Being with me was destroying her future. So I let her go."

"Let her go." Sam exhales smoke. "That what you call it?"

"What else would I call it?"

"Running away because you're scared."

The words hit harder than they should. "I'm not running. I'm being realistic."

"You're being your father."

I turn to stare at him. "What?"

"Roy used to do the same thing. Every time something good happened, he'd sabotage it. Said he wasn't worthy, said he'd just mess it up anyway, might as well end it first. Then he'd drink himself stupid and blame everyone but himself." Sam looks at me. "You're doing the same thing. Different method, same result."

"I'm nothing like him."

"You're exactly like him. Convinced you don't deserve good things. Convinced you'll ruin them if you try. So you push away anything that might make you happy before it can prove you wrong."

"That's not—" But is it? Is that what I'm doing? Ending things with Elizabeth before I can fail her the way my father failed my mother?

"Elizabeth wanted to be with you," Sam says quietly. "Despite everything. Her father, the town, all of it. She chose you. And you threw that back in her face because you decided you knew better than her what she needed."

"I do know better. She's seventeen. She doesn't understand—"

"She understands plenty. And you treating her like a child who can't make her own decisions? That's not protecting her, Jake. That's insulting her."

The words land like a fist. Because he's right. I told myself I was being noble, sacrificing for her sake. But really I was deciding for her. Taking away her choice because I was too scared to trust that she knew what she wanted.

Too scared to trust that maybe I could be what she wanted.

"I messed up," I say quietly.

"Yep."

"She probably hates me now."

"Probably."

"So what do I do?"

Sam stands up, brushes off his pants. "That's not for me to say. But sitting out here feeling sorry for yourself isn't fixing anything."

He walks back to his truck, leaves me alone with the dark water and the stars and the crushing weight of my own stupidity.

Two weeks. I've been without her for two weeks and it feels like two years.

Her father said if I loved her, I'd let her go.

But maybe loving her means fighting for her instead. Even if I'm scared. Even if I might fail. Even if the whole town says I'm not good enough.

Maybe love is about trusting that she knows her own mind. And being brave enough to believe I might be worthy of her after all.

I ride home slowly through the dark streets. When I get there, my mother's waiting up.

"You okay?" she asks.

"No," I say. The first honest thing I've said in two weeks.

She pulls me into a hug, and I let her, and for the first time since I pushed Elizabeth away, I let myself feel how badly I've broken us both.

Tomorrow I'll figure out how to fix it.

Tonight I just need to stop lying to myself about why I did it.
