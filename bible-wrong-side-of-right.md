# BIBLE: Wrong Side of Right

## Story Premise

Jake Cooper is Millbrook's resident greaser—eighteen, works at Sam's Garage, rides a motorcycle, and lives on the wrong side of everything that matters in small-town Indiana. When Mayor Hayes's daughter Elizabeth brings her father's Buick in for repairs, Jake knows a girl like her has no business with a guy like him. But Elizabeth keeps coming back, seeing past his leather jacket and reputation to the person underneath. As Jake falls hard despite every instinct telling him to stay away, he'll have to choose between protecting her from his world or being brave enough to fight for a future together.

## Protagonist: Jake Cooper

**Age:** 18

**Background:** Jake lives on the wrong side of the tracks in Millbrook, Indiana, in a small rental house with his mother who works double shifts at the town diner. His father walked out when Jake was ten, leaving behind debt, shame, and a reputation Jake can't escape. Jake dropped out of school at sixteen to work full-time at Sam's Garage, where he's become a skilled mechanic. He rebuilt his motorcycle from salvage parts—it's his pride and the one thing that's truly his.

**Personality:** Jake wears his toughness like armor—leather jacket, slicked-back hair, cigarette behind his ear, the works. He's got a quick temper and fists to match, known for getting into fights with guys who disrespect him or his crew. He walks with a swagger that dares anyone to say something, and he's got the bruised knuckles to back it up. But underneath the greaser exterior, Jake's smart and introspective. He reads library books in secret—mechanics manuals but also novels he'd never admit to enjoying—and dreams of building custom motorcycles someday, bikes that would make people stop and stare for the right reasons. He's fiercely loyal to the few people he cares about, would take a beating for Tommy or Sam without hesitation. He's defensive about his reputation because he knows the town has already written him off as his father's son—no good and going nowhere. Jake's got a poet's eye for detail even though he'd punch anyone who called him that, noticing things like how engine grease never quite washes off your hands or how Elizabeth's hair catches the light.

**Goal:** Jake wants to prove he's more than his father's mistakes, though he'd never admit it out loud. He wants to be good at something that matters, to build bikes that people respect, and maybe—just maybe—to be someone worth more than the nothing everyone expects.

**Fear/Obstacle:** Jake's terrified of becoming his father—someone who ruins everything he touches and abandons the people who depend on him. He believes he's fundamentally wrong for someone like Elizabeth, that his world is too dark and broken, and that loving her means dragging her down with him.

**Arc:** Jake starts believing he's destined to be nothing, that his reputation defines his worth, and that wanting anything better is pointless. Through Elizabeth's belief in him and his own realization that being worthy isn't about where you come from but about who you choose to be, Jake learns to fight for what he wants instead of accepting what everyone else thinks he deserves. He chooses courage over fear, commitment over running, and builds toward a future on his own terms.

## Love Interest: Elizabeth Hayes

**Age:** 17

**Background:** Elizabeth is Mayor Hayes's only daughter, raised in Millbrook's finest house on Elm Street with every advantage. Her mother died when Elizabeth was twelve, leaving her father to mold her into the perfect mayor's daughter—proper, polite, involved in all the right activities. She attends Millbrook High, maintains perfect grades, and is expected to date respectable boys from respectable families. Her father has her future mapped out: teaching college, suitable marriage, upstanding life.

**Personality:** Elizabeth appears to be exactly what everyone expects—poised, well-mannered, the model daughter who knows which fork to use and how to smile through boring dinner parties. But underneath the pearls and perfect posture, she's smart, curious, and suffocating under the weight of constant performance. She's tired of being decorative, of smiling through town events where she's displayed like a trophy, of being her father's political asset rather than a real person. Elizabeth is genuinely interested in how things work—she asks questions everyone else is too polite to ask, wants to understand the mechanics of engines and systems, not just accept what she's told. She sees through social pretense to what's actually real, can spot a phony compliment or political maneuver from across the room. She's braver than anyone gives her credit for, including herself, with a quiet steel underneath the polished exterior. She reads voraciously, everything from romance novels to automotive magazines she sneaks from her father's study. Elizabeth has opinions she's learned to keep to herself, frustrations she channels into maintaining her perfect facade, and a hunger for something authentic in a world that values appearance above all.

**Initial Barrier:** Elizabeth is everything Jake can't have—mayor's daughter, respectable family, future full of opportunities. Being seen with Jake would destroy her reputation, enrage her father, and mark her as "that kind of girl" in a town that never forgets. Jake knows he should be invisible to her, and she should want nothing to do with someone like him.

**Hidden Depth:** Elizabeth isn't interested in safe or approved—she's drawn to authenticity. She sees that Jake's "bad boy" reputation masks someone intelligent, skilled, and genuine. She's fascinated by his mechanical ability, his refusal to perform for anyone, and the way he's honest about who he is even when it costs him. Elizabeth recognizes in Jake the realness she craves in her own constrained life.

**Arc:** Elizabeth begins the story performing her role as the perfect daughter, believing that's what being good means. Through her relationship with Jake, she discovers that real goodness isn't about meeting expectations—it's about honoring what's true. She learns to value authenticity over approval and finds the courage to choose what she wants over what she's supposed to want, standing up to her father and the town's judgment.

## Supporting Cast

### Sam Henderson - Garage Owner & Mentor

Sam owns Sam's Garage and gave Jake a job when no one else would hire Roy Cooper's kid. He's in his fifties, gruff but fair, a Korean War veteran with a limp from shrapnel and no patience for excuses. Sam doesn't care about Jake's family history or what side of the tracks he's from—only whether he shows up on time and does the work right. He's teaching Jake not just mechanics but responsibility, showing him that skill and character matter more than reputation or family name. Sam sees Jake's natural mechanical talent, the way he understands engines almost instinctively, and tries to nurture it despite Jake's defensive attitude. He's protective of Jake in his rough way, warns him about getting involved with Elizabeth because he knows how the town works and how badly Jake could get hurt. But Sam ultimately respects Jake's choices and autonomy, even when he disagrees. Sam represents the possibility of redemption through honest work, proving yourself through what you do rather than what people say about you. He's the father figure Jake never had, though neither of them would use those words.

### Tommy Blake - Best Friend & Crew Member

Tommy is Jake's best friend since they were eight years old, fellow greaser who works at the lumber yard hauling boards and running the saw. He's loyal to a fault, always ready to back Jake up in a fight, no questions asked, rides his own motorcycle—a beat-up Triumph he's constantly tinkering with. Tommy's got a quick laugh and a reckless streak, the kind of guy who suggests drag racing on Main Street at midnight just to see if they can get away with it. He embodies the life Jake's expected to live—accept your place on the wrong side of the tracks, don't reach for more than you're supposed to have, take what you can get and don't complain. Tommy's skeptical of Jake's relationship with Elizabeth from the start, warns him he's headed for heartbreak and humiliation, that girls like her don't end up with guys like them no matter how many pretty words get exchanged. But despite his doubts, Tommy ultimately stands by Jake even when he doesn't understand his choices, proving that loyalty matters more than agreement. Tommy represents the pull of Jake's old life and the genuine friendship that exists there, showing that the wrong side of the tracks isn't just poverty and hardship—it's also brotherhood and belonging.

### Mayor Richard Hayes - Primary Antagonist

Elizabeth's father, Millbrook's mayor for twelve years, a man who built his political career on respectability, proper appearances, and traditional values. He's a widower who lost his wife five years ago and since then has poured himself into both his political position and raising Elizabeth according to strict standards. He's not cruel or deliberately unkind, but he's rigid in his beliefs about class, reputation, and what's appropriate for his daughter and his family name. Warren genuinely loves Elizabeth but sees her as something to be protected and shaped rather than understood. He sees Jake as a threat on multiple levels—not just to Elizabeth's future but to his own political image and the family legacy he's trying to preserve. Warren represents the town's judgment and class divisions made flesh, the authority figure Jake must eventually stand up to despite the power imbalance. His conviction that he's protecting Elizabeth makes him a more complex obstacle than simple villainy—he believes he's being a good father, which makes the conflict more painful for Elizabeth and more difficult for Jake to navigate.

### Linda Miller - Elizabeth's Friend

Elizabeth's classmate and one of her few real friends, daughter of the town pharmacist. Linda is more conventional than Elizabeth, dates the football team captain, but she's genuinely kind and worries about Elizabeth's reputation. She represents the voice of social consequence—she likes Jake but warns Elizabeth about what dating him will cost. Linda serves as the bridge between Elizabeth's two worlds and shows Elizabeth what she'll lose if she chooses Jake, making the choice more meaningful.

### Roy Cooper - Jake's Father (absent but present)

Jake's father left ten years ago but haunts the story through Jake's internal conflict. Roy was a drinker, got in trouble, borrowed money from the wrong people, and abandoned his family when things got too hard. Jake's reputation is built on being Roy's son, and Jake's greatest fear is becoming him. Roy represents Jake's legacy of failure and the pattern Jake must consciously break to build a different future.

### Danny Walsh - Rival/Antagonist

Danny is a few years older than Jake, runs with a rougher crowd, one of Roy's old associates. He represents the darker side of the tracks—petty crime, violence, the path Jake could easily slip into. When Danny pulls Jake into collecting on an old debt, the situation turns violent, exposing Jake to Elizabeth's world as genuinely dangerous. Danny serves as both antagonist and cautionary tale, showing what Jake could become if he doesn't choose differently.

## Setting: Millbrook, Indiana

**Time:** Summer 1957

**Key Locations:**
- **Sam's Garage:** East side of town, Jake's workplace and refuge, where he's competent and valued, filled with the smell of motor oil and the sound of engines—his safe space.
- **The Tracks:** Literal railroad tracks dividing respectable Millbrook from the working-class east side, the physical manifestation of the town's class divide Jake crosses daily.
- **Hayes House on Elm Street:** Large Victorian on tree-lined street, represents everything Jake can't have, where Elizabeth lives her constrained life as the mayor's daughter.
- **The Quarry:** Abandoned limestone quarry outside town, where Jake and Elizabeth meet in secret, away from judgment and eyes—neutral ground between their two worlds.
- **Main Street/Town Square:** Heart of respectable Millbrook with its soda fountain, town hall, church, where everyone sees everything and reputation is made or destroyed.

**Period Details:** Summer 1957 is post-Korean War, pre-Vietnam, when rock and roll is corrupting youth in adult eyes. Elvis is scandalous, motorcycles mark you as trouble, and James Dean's "Rebel Without a Cause" defines the bad boy aesthetic. Millbrook is traditional small-town Indiana—church on Sunday, town events, rigid social structure where class divisions are absolute and crossing them is social suicide.

**Atmosphere:** Millbrook feels claustrophobic despite its open farmland setting—everyone knows everyone's business, reputation is everything, and escape seems impossible. There's a weight of expectation and judgment pressing down constantly, the sense that your family history determines your future and no amount of effort can change what the town has decided about you. The gossip network is faster than the telephone, and being seen in the wrong place with the wrong person can destroy years of carefully maintained reputation overnight. But there's also beauty in the Indiana summer—fireflies dancing over cornfields on humid nights, the freedom of the open road on a motorcycle with wind in your face, thunderstorms that roll across flat land with nowhere to hide, the possibility that exists outside town limits if you're brave enough to reach for it. There's romance in the small-town setting too—the soda fountain where everyone gathers, the drive-in movie theater on Route 9, the quarry where teenagers go to be alone, the Fourth of July celebration that brings the whole town together. It's a place where you can feel trapped and held at the same time, where leaving means escape but staying means home.

## Tone & Voice

First-person from Jake's perspective, authentic male teen voice circa 1957. Jake's narration is direct and unpretentious—he doesn't waste words or perform emotions. His voice has edge and defensiveness, the toughness of someone who's been hurt and expects to be hurt again. But in his internal monologue, vulnerability shows through—his fear of becoming his father, his awareness of how Elizabeth sees him, his surprised tenderness when he looks at her. The narrative balances period-appropriate male reticence about feelings with emotional honesty that lets readers inside his walls. Jake notices mechanical details, physical sensations, what people's hands do when they talk. His voice has the poetry of someone who pays attention even when he pretends not to care.

## Theme

Jake's journey is about choosing who you become despite where you come from. The novel explores how reputation and family history can imprison you, making you believe you deserve nothing better than what others expect. Through Elizabeth's belief in him and his own hard choices, Jake learns that being worthy isn't about erasing your past or becoming someone else—it's about having the courage to build toward something better and to accept love even when you don't think you deserve it. The theme resonates with unworthiness, redemption, and the transformative power of being truly seen by someone who matters.

## Romance Trope(s)

Wrong side of the tracks romance with bad boy/good girl dynamic. Jake is the classic greaser—leather jacket, motorcycle, reputation—while Elizabeth is the untouchable mayor's daughter. The story follows the "he falls first and harder" pattern, with Jake trying to protect Elizabeth from himself and his world, convinced he's wrong for her. The romance builds through forced proximity (she keeps coming to the garage), forbidden attraction, and the tension of their impossible situation. Jake's internal conflict—wanting her desperately while believing he'll only hurt her—drives the emotional arc toward his ultimate choice to be brave enough to fight for their future together.
