# Chapter 15: Falling Hard

It hit me on a Friday afternoon while I was rebuilding a carburetor.

One minute I was working, focused on the delicate balance of fuel and air, the precision required to make an engine run smooth. The next minute Elizabeth laughed at something Sam said from across the garage, and the sound went through me like lightning.

And I knew.

I was in love with her.

Actually, completely, terrifyingly in love.

My hands stopped moving. The carburetor sat half-assembled on the workbench, parts scattered around it, but I couldn't make myself pick up another piece. Couldn't make my fingers work. Couldn't do anything except stand there trying to breathe through the enormity of what I'd just realized.

This wasn't supposed to happen. Not to people like me. Not with girls like her.

"Jake? You okay?" Sam's voice, concerned.

I looked up. Sam was watching me from the office doorway, and Elizabeth was by her Chevrolet, also watching, worry clear on her face.

"Yeah. Fine. Just—need some air."

I walked outside before either of them could ask questions, stood in the summer heat trying to get my heart rate under control. This was bad. This was so much worse than I'd thought.

Caring about her was one thing. Wanting her was something I could handle. But loving her? That changed everything. That made every risk real, every potential loss devastating, every moment together both precious and terrifying.

Love made you vulnerable in ways I'd sworn I'd never be vulnerable again.

The door opened behind me. Elizabeth.

"Hey," she said softly. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing. Just needed a break."

"Jake." She came closer, touched my arm. "Talk to me."

I looked at her—blue-gray eyes full of concern, sundress with daisies on it, hair pulled back with a ribbon, grease smudge on her cheek from where she'd touched her face while helping Sam organize parts. Beautiful and real and completely impossible.

"I'm okay," I lied. "Promise."

She didn't believe me. I could see it in her eyes. But she let it go, squeezed my arm once, and went back inside.

I stood there in the sun trying to figure out how to handle this. How to love someone when love had always meant eventual loss. How to trust that she wouldn't leave when everyone always left. How to be brave enough to say the words when saying them out loud made them real and real things could be destroyed.

By the time I went back inside, I'd convinced myself to keep quiet. To not say it. To protect both of us by keeping this feeling locked inside where it couldn't hurt anyone.

The afternoon dragged. Every time Elizabeth smiled at me, every time our hands brushed passing tools, every time she asked a question about engines with genuine interest—it all made my chest tight with this enormous feeling I couldn't name out loud.

When closing time came, Elizabeth lingered until Sam left.

"Quarry?" she asked.

"Yeah. Give me ten minutes to lock up."

She kissed me quick before leaving, and the touch of her lips made everything worse and better simultaneously.

I locked up the garage, climbed on my Indian, and headed for the quarry trying to figure out what to do with everything I was feeling. With the knowledge that I'd fallen so hard there was no climbing back out.

Elizabeth was already there when I arrived, sitting on the limestone edge with her shoes off, looking out at the water. The evening sun turned everything gold—the quarry water, the trees, her hair. She looked like something from a dream, too good to be real, too perfect to last.

I killed the engine and walked over, and she turned to greet me with that smile that made my heart skip.

"Hi."

"Hi," I said, sitting beside her.

"You were weird today. At the garage. Want to tell me why?"

"Just had a lot on my mind."

"About what?"

About you. About how I'm in love with you and it terrifies me. About how I can't imagine my life without you in it and that vulnerability is killing me. About how every minute with you is precious because summer's ending and I don't know how we'll make this work when you're at college and I'm here and your father still doesn't know and the whole world is against us.

"Just stuff," I said instead.

Elizabeth studied me for a long moment. Then she took my hand and threaded her fingers through mine.

"You're scared," she said. Not a question. A statement.

"Yeah."

"Of what?"

"Everything. Your father finding out. You realizing this was a mistake. Summer ending. You leaving for college and meeting someone better—"

"Stop." She squeezed my hand. "I'm not leaving you just because I'm going to college. I told you that."

"I know what you told me. But people say things. Make promises they can't keep. You can't know what you'll want three months from now."

"Neither can you. But I know what I want right now." She turned to face me fully. "You, Jake. Complicated as it is, impossible as it might be. I want you."

The words were there, right on the edge of my tongue. I love you. But they stuck, caught in my throat, too big and too real to let out.

So instead I kissed her.

Not gentle like usual. Desperate. Like she was oxygen and I'd been drowning. Like she was the only real thing in a fake world and if I held on tight enough maybe I could keep her.

Elizabeth responded immediately, her hand coming up to touch my face, her lips moving against mine with equal intensity. Like she understood what I couldn't say. Like she felt it too.

When we finally broke apart, both breathing hard, she rested her forehead against mine.

"Whatever you're afraid of," she whispered, "I'm afraid of it too. But I'm more afraid of not trying."

"I almost told you something today," I admitted. "Something I've never told anyone."

"You can tell me. Whatever it is."

But I couldn't. Not yet. Not when saying it out loud would make it real, would give it power to hurt me when it inevitably ended.

"Someday," I said instead. "When I'm braver."

"You're already brave. The bravest person I know." She kissed me soft and sweet. "But I can wait. For whatever you need to tell me. I'm not going anywhere."

We lay back on the limestone, looking up at the sky as it shifted from gold to pink to deep blue. Stars appeared one by one, familiar constellations I'd shown her before, and Elizabeth's hand stayed in mine.

"What do you think happens?" she asked quietly. "After summer? When real life starts again?"

"I don't know. We figure it out as we go, I guess."

"My father's going to find out eventually. About us."

"I know."

"It's going to be bad. Really bad."

"I know that too."

She was quiet for a moment. "Are you going to run when it gets bad? Tell me truth."

I thought about it. About my father walking away. About Shane riding into the mountains. About all the ways people ran from hard things and called it noble.

"No," I said. "I'm not going to run. I promised you that."

"Good." She squeezed my hand. "Because I love you."

The words hung in the air between us, simple and enormous and everything.

She'd said it. Just said it like it was easy, like it wasn't the most terrifying truth in the world.

"Elizabeth—"

"You don't have to say it back. I know you're not ready. But I needed you to know." She turned her head to look at me. "I love you, Jake Cooper. Scared and brave and complicated you. And whatever happens, that's not going to change."

My chest felt too tight, too full, too everything. She loved me. This impossible girl with her blue-gray eyes and her fierce heart loved me.

"I—" The words stuck again, caught on years of fear and loss and certainty that good things didn't happen to people like me.

"It's okay," Elizabeth said. "I can wait."

She turned back to the stars, and I lay there beside her trying to process what she'd said. That she loved me. That she wasn't going anywhere. That maybe, impossibly, this thing between us was real and lasting and worth fighting for.

The stars filled the sky, bright and countless, and Elizabeth's hand stayed warm in mine. And lying there in the summer dark, I let myself believe it. Let myself hope.

Maybe love did make you vulnerable. Maybe it did expose you to loss in ways nothing else could. Maybe it was terrifying and impossible and absolutely ridiculous.

But maybe it was also worth it.

"Elizabeth?"

"Yeah?"

"I—" The words were right there, so close. But I still couldn't quite say them. "Thank you. For being brave enough for both of us."

She smiled, and even in the dark I could see it. "We take turns being brave. That's how this works."

We stayed at the quarry until the stars felt close enough to touch, until the night air turned cool and we finally had to leave. And when I took Elizabeth home, dropping her off a block from her house like always, she kissed me one more time.

"I meant what I said," she whispered. "I love you."

"I know," I said. And then, because I was trying to be braver: "Someday soon I'll say it back."

"I know you will."

I watched her walk away, then rode home through the empty streets thinking about love and vulnerability and all the ways caring about someone made you both stronger and weaker.

She loved me.

And I loved her.

Even if I couldn't quite say it yet, it was true.

And that changed everything.
