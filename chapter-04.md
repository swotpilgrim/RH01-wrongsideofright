# Chapter 4: She Comes Back

Saturday came with the same relentless heat as every other day that week. I'd been at work since seven, telling myself I always started early on Saturdays, that this had nothing to do with Elizabeth Hayes.

The lie didn't hold.

I was reorganizing my tool bench for the third time when I heard an engine pulling in. Something lighter than the Buick, with a tick in the valve train.

The 1953 Chevrolet Bel Air was pale green with chrome trim. Practical, safe, reliable.

Elizabeth climbed out wearing pants. Navy blue, cuffed at the ankle, paired with a white blouse. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, flat shoes instead of heels. She looked ready to work.

"Good morning," she called, pulling a small notebook from the Chevy. "Am I too early?"

"No. Right on time." I walked toward the car, giving it the automatic assessment every mechanic does. Clean exterior, well-maintained chrome, tires in good shape. "This your Chevrolet?"

"Yes. My father gave it to me last year." She patted the hood. "I call her Daisy."

"Daisy?"

"The color reminded me of spring. I know it's silly—"

"It's not silly. My motorcycle's called Chief. Things you care about deserve names."

Her smile lit the garage. "Exactly."

I focused on the car. "You said there was a concerning sound?"

"Yes. A ticking noise when I drive. It gets faster when I accelerate. I'm worried—"

"Let me listen." I gestured to the door. "Start it up."

Elizabeth slid behind the wheel and turned the key. The engine caught immediately, settling into a steady idle. I leaned toward the hood, listening, cataloging sounds the way Sam had taught me. The tick was there—regular, rhythmic, speeding up when she gave it gas.

Not a fuel pump. Not a bearing. Not anything broken. Just valves needing adjustment.

"Can you hear it?" Elizabeth asked through the open window.

"Yeah, I hear it. Give me a minute."

I popped the hood, secured the prop rod, and looked at the straight-six engine. Clean, well-maintained, nothing obviously wrong. The ticking was coming from the valve train, exactly like I'd thought. I traced the sound to its source, checked the valve clearances with my fingers, felt what I'd expected to find—gaps wider than they should be.

"You can turn it off," I called.

Elizabeth killed the engine and came to stand beside me at the fender, looking at the exposed engine with the kind of curiosity most customers never showed. Like she actually wanted to understand, not just have the problem fixed.

"Is it serious?"

"It's not serious at all. That's your valves." I reached in and manually rotated one of the rocker arms. "These open and close to let fuel in and exhaust out. They need a tiny gap—called valve lash—to work right. Your gaps are a little wide, that's the ticking sound."

"Is that dangerous?"

"Not dangerous. Just loud. They should be adjusted, but it's not an emergency. Car'll run fine either way."

Relief washed over her face. "Oh thank goodness. I was so worried I'd damaged something driving it."

"You didn't damage anything. This is normal wear, happens over time. Every car needs valve adjustments eventually." I grabbed a rag, wiped my hands. "I can adjust them if you want. Won't take long."

"Would you show me how?"

I looked at her—standing there in work pants, notebook ready, genuinely interested. The smart answer was no.

"Yeah," I said. "I can show you."

"Really?"

"It's not complicated. Just precise." I gestured to the engine. "Good skill to have."

"What do I do first?"

"First, let the engine cool. Can't touch anything hot. I'll show you the tools."

I pulled out the feeler gauges, the thin metal blades rattling together. "These measure gap width. See? Each blade is a different thickness, marked in thousandths of an inch. Your Chevy needs twelve-thousandths cold. We'll check each valve, adjust the ones that are off."

Elizabeth examined them carefully, running her finger over the stamped numbers. "Twelve-thousandths. That's so precise."

"Has to be. Too tight, valve can't close all the way, loses compression. Too loose, you get that ticking." I grabbed the Chevrolet service manual from the shelf, flipped to the engine section, showed her the valve specifications printed right there in black and white. "It's all in here. Every spec you need."

She leaned in to read, shoulder almost touching mine. I caught that light perfume again, mixing with motor oil and old paper. Something floral and clean that shouldn't work in a garage but somehow did.

"There's so much information," she said. "Torque specifications, clearances, timing marks. How do you learn all this?"

"Practice. Repetition. Reading the manual first." I grabbed the combination wrenches we'd need. "Most people try to wing it, mess things up, then blame the car. Manual tells you exactly what to do if you're willing to read it."

"My father thinks I shouldn't bother with mechanical things. He says that's what mechanics are for." She looked up from the manual. "But I drive this car every day. Shouldn't I understand how it works? What to do if something goes wrong?"

"Yeah. Everyone who drives should know basic maintenance. How to check oil, recognize problems, handle emergencies."

"Will you teach me? Not just the valves—basic maintenance. How to check oil, change a tire, things every driver should know."

"Okay," I heard myself say. "I can teach you the basics."

"Truly?"

"You're smart enough to learn it."

Pink colored her cheeks. "No one's ever called me smart for wanting to know how things work."

"It's not peculiar. It's practical." I grabbed the valve cover wrench. "Let's start with these valves."

For the next hour, I walked Elizabeth through valve adjustment. Showed her how to rotate the engine to position each valve at its adjustment point, how to slide the feeler gauge into the gap between rocker arm and valve stem, how to loosen the locknut and turn the adjustment screw until the clearance was exactly right—tight enough to be secure, loose enough to let the feeler gauge slide through.

She was a good student—careful, attentive, asking questions that showed she was thinking about what I was teaching her. Her hands were tentative at first, afraid of breaking something or doing it wrong, but once she got the feel of it she worked with quiet confidence.

"Like this?" She held the feeler gauge against the third valve, checking her adjustment.

I leaned in to see. "Perfect. That's exactly twelve-thousandths. Now lock it down—hold the screw steady, tighten the locknut. Don't let the screw turn or you'll change the gap."

She did it carefully, tongue between her teeth in concentration, hands steady.

"Did I do it right?"

"Check it again. If the gap's still right, you did it perfect."

She tested it, and the feeler gauge slid in with just the right amount of resistance—not loose, not tight. "It's right!"

"See? Not complicated. Just precise."

"You're a good teacher, Jake."

I wasn't used to compliments. Didn't know what to do with them when they came from a girl like her. "You're a good student. Makes it easy."

We finished the rest of the valves together, her confidence growing with each one. By the time we bolted the valve cover back on and started the engine to test it, Elizabeth was grinning with pride.

The engine purred smooth and quiet, the ticking gone.

"I did that," she said, wonder in her voice. "I actually fixed it."

"You did. All I did was show you where things were."

She looked at the engine, then at me. "When can we do the next lesson?"

"Next Saturday?" The words came out before I could stop them.

"Next Saturday. I'll be here." She wiped her hands, grease under her fingernails. "Thank you, Jake. This means a lot."

"Just teaching you what you should know."

"It's more than that. You're showing me I'm not helpless." She met my eyes. "That matters."

I just nodded.

Sam emerged from the office, took in the scene—Elizabeth with grease on her hands, me standing too close.

"Everything alright?" he asked.

"Jake taught me to adjust my valves," Elizabeth said. "The car sounds wonderful."

"That's good." Sam looked at me, a whole conversation in that look. "Glad we could help, Miss Hayes."

"I should go. My father will wonder where I've been." She grabbed her notebook. "See you next Saturday, Jake?"

"Yeah. Next Saturday."

She climbed into her Chevrolet, engine starting with a quiet purr. She waved once, then pulled out.

Sam waited until she was gone.

"You know what you're doing?"

"Teaching her basic maintenance."

"That what we're calling it?"

"I'm being careful."

"Careful would be saying no. Nice girls from her world don't end up with boys from ours."

"I know."

"Knowing and stopping are different things."

Sam went back to the office. I stood in the empty bay, smelling motor oil and perfume, still feeling her smile.

Sam was right.

But next Saturday suddenly seemed worth waiting for.
