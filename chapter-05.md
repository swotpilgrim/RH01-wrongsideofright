# Chapter 5: The Excuse

Three days later, Elizabeth's Chevrolet pulled into Sam's Garage again.

I was changing brake pads on a Ford pickup when I heard that now-familiar engine, the smooth purr that said the valve adjustment had held. I rolled out from under the Ford, wiped my hands on a rag, and stepped into the sunlight.

Elizabeth climbed out looking apologetic, wearing a blue dress today with white buttons down the front. Back to proper mayor's daughter clothes instead of work pants. She bit her lip when she saw me, and I knew before she said a word that this was another excuse.

"Hi, Jake."

"Hi." I walked over, unable to stop myself from looking for whatever imaginary problem she'd dreamed up this time. "Something wrong with Daisy?"

"I think so. She's running rough. Not like before, but... rougher than she should."

"Rougher how?"

"I don't know exactly. Just not as smooth." She gestured helplessly at the Chevrolet. "Can you check?"

I could've called her on it right there. Could've said the car was running fine, that she was making excuses to come back here, that we both knew what this was really about. But I didn't.

"Yeah. Let me take a look."

I slid behind the wheel, and her perfume lingered in the car—that light floral scent that had no business making my chest tight. I started the engine, listened. Smooth idle, no hesitation, no roughness. Exactly what I'd expected.

I revved it gently, listening for anything off. Nothing. The Chevy ran like a dream.

Elizabeth stood at the door, watching me with those blue-gray eyes, waiting.

I could send her home. Should send her home. This was getting dangerous—her coming here every few days with manufactured problems, me pretending to buy it, both of us dancing around what was really happening.

Instead, I killed the engine and climbed out.

"Pop the hood. Let me check the carburetor."

Relief flashed across her face. "Okay."

She popped the hood, and I propped it open, leaned over the engine I'd just worked on days ago. Everything was exactly as it should be. Carburetor settings perfect, air filter clean, vacuum lines secure.

I reached down and adjusted the idle mixture screw a quarter turn. Didn't need adjusting, but it gave me something to do, some reason to justify her being here.

"Try it now."

Elizabeth started the engine. It sounded exactly the same—perfect. But she nodded like she heard a difference.

"That's better. Much smoother."

"Good." I closed the hood, wiped my hands. "Carburetor was running a little lean. Should be fine now."

"Thank you." She stood there, not making any move to leave, and I knew we were at a crossroads. I could let her drive away, could keep up this charade of her inventing car problems so she had an excuse to see me.

Or I could say what we were both thinking.

"There wasn't anything wrong with your car," I said quietly.

Pink colored her cheeks, but she didn't look away. "No. There wasn't."

"You know you don't need an excuse, right? To come here. You're scheduled for Saturday anyway."

"Saturday's four days away." The words came out soft, almost defiant. "And I can't exactly tell my father I'm visiting Sam's Garage to see you. He already asks questions about why my car needs so much work."

That stopped me cold. "He's asking questions?"

"Nothing serious. Just commenting on how often Daisy seems to need attention." She looked at the Chevrolet fondly. "I told him I'm being thorough about maintenance since I don't know much about cars. He seemed to accept that."

"Elizabeth..." I didn't even know what I wanted to say. That this was dangerous? That her father was right to be suspicious? That we should stop before this became something neither of us could take back?

"I know," she said, reading my expression. "I know this is... complicated. That people would talk if they knew. That my father would be furious." She met my eyes. "But I like talking to you, Jake. You treat me like I have a brain. Like my questions matter. Like I'm a person instead of just the mayor's daughter."

My chest felt too tight. "You are a person. Smart person. Anyone who can't see that is an idiot."

Her smile was soft, real. "See? That's what I mean. You don't dismiss me."

"Why would I dismiss you?"

"Because that's what everyone else does. They smile and nod and pat my hand and tell me not to worry about complicated things." Frustration crept into her voice. "My father, his associates, the boys he introduces me to at town events. They all treat me like I'm decorative. Something to be admired but not actually listened to."

I leaned against the Chevy's fender, studying her. The perfect hair, the neat dress, the pearls at her throat. She looked like she belonged in a magazine advertisement for perfect American families. But underneath that polished exterior was someone who wanted to be seen for more than appearances.

I understood that more than she probably knew.

"So you invent car problems so you can come talk to someone who'll actually listen?" I asked.

"Is that terrible?"

"It's kind of smart, actually. Gives you a legitimate reason to be here."

"Thank you for playing along." She bit her lip again. "If you want me to stop, I will. I don't want to make trouble for you or Sam."

I should want her to stop. Should tell her this was getting too complicated, that her father was already asking questions, that we needed to keep our distance until Saturday's scheduled lesson and nothing more.

But I didn't want her to stop.

"I don't want you to stop," I said. "But we need to be careful. Your father gets suspicious, he could make things difficult."

"For you?"

"For both of us. But yeah, mostly for me." I shoved my hands in my coverall pockets. "I'm Roy Cooper's kid working at a garage on the edge of respectable. Your father's the mayor. That's not a fight I'd win."

Understanding flickered in her eyes. "You think he'd go after your job?"

"I think he'd go after anything he thought threatened you. And me spending time with you? He'd see that as a threat."

"That's not fair."

"Fair's got nothing to do with it. That's just how it is."

She was quiet for a moment, thinking. Then: "What if we were just being careful? I come for legitimate lessons on Saturdays, and if I happen to need occasional repairs during the week, well, cars do need maintenance, don't they?"

"Yours doesn't need as much as you're claiming."

"Maybe I'm just very concerned about preventive care." Her eyes had a spark of mischief that made me want to smile.

"Preventive care. That what we're calling it?"

"Why not? It sounds respectable and responsible. Two things my father values highly."

She had a point. Her father couldn't really object to her being thorough about car maintenance, even if the frequency was suspicious. And as long as we kept things looking innocent—just a girl learning about her car from a mechanic—we could probably get away with it.

Probably.

"Okay," I said. "Preventive care. But if your father asks direct questions, you tell him the truth about what I'm teaching you. Don't lie for me."

"I won't lie. But I don't have to volunteer information he's not asking for, do I?"

"I guess not."

"Then we're agreed. Regular lessons on Saturdays, and if I occasionally need your professional expertise during the week, I'll come by." She smiled. "Purely for preventive care purposes."

"Purely professional."

"Absolutely."

We were both lying, and we both knew it. But the lie let us pretend this was innocent, that there was nothing happening between the mayor's daughter and the grease monkey that anyone needed to worry about.

Sam emerged from the office, took one look at us standing close to the Chevrolet, and sighed.

"Miss Hayes. Car trouble again?"

"Just a minor carburetor adjustment," Elizabeth said smoothly. "Jake fixed it right up."

"I'm sure he did." Sam looked at me, a warning in his eyes, then back to Elizabeth with his customer-service face. "No charge for minor adjustments, Miss Hayes. Consider it follow-up to Saturday's work."

"That's very kind. Thank you, Mr. Henderson." She pulled a dollar from her purse anyway, handed it to Sam. "For your trouble."

Sam took it because refusing would've been rude. "Appreciate it. You take care now."

"I will. And I'll see you Saturday, Jake? For the oil change lesson?"

"Saturday. Ten o'clock."

"Perfect." She climbed into her Chevrolet, started that smooth-running engine, and waved once before pulling out.

Sam waited until she was gone before turning to me.

"You know what you're doing?" It was becoming his favorite question.

"Being careful."

"Doesn't look careful from where I'm standing. Looks like you're both making excuses to see each other and hoping nobody notices."

"Her father's already noticing. She said he's asking questions about why her car needs so much work."

Sam's expression darkened. "That's a warning, Jake. Mayor starts asking questions, he starts watching. You want him watching you?"

"No."

"Then maybe you should think about where this is heading."

"I know where it's heading. Nowhere good. But Sam..." I struggled to find words for the feeling in my chest. "When she looks at me, she doesn't see Cooper's kid or the garage grease monkey. She sees me. And when she asks about engines and how things work, she actually cares about the answers. Nobody's ever looked at me like that before."

Sam's expression softened. "I know. But that doesn't change who her father is or what side of the tracks you're on."

"I know that too."

"Do you? Because from where I'm standing, you're about to get your heart broken. And probably lose your job in the process."

He wasn't wrong. I knew he wasn't wrong. But when Elizabeth smiled at me like I mattered, when she showed up with invented car problems just to have an excuse to talk, when she looked at me like I was worth seeing instead of worth avoiding—it felt worth the risk.

Even though I knew better.

"I'll be careful," I said again.

Sam shook his head. "Careful would be saying no. But I can see that ship's sailed. Just... try not to get fired, okay? I like having you around."

"I'll do my best."

He went back to the office, and I stood in the empty bay, still smelling that light perfume mixed with motor oil, still seeing those blue-gray eyes looking at me like I was someone who mattered.

Saturday was four days away.

I was already counting the hours.
