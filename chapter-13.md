# Chapter 13: Opening Up

The diner was called Rosie's—not the same Rosie's where Ma worked, but close enough in name to make me smile. Small town Indiana, where every third diner was named after someone's grandmother.

We pulled into the gravel parking lot just after eleven, the ride having taken forty minutes on roads that curved through farmland and small towns I'd never bothered to visit. The place was busy but not packed—farmers in for late breakfast, a few families, an elderly couple in the corner booth sharing coffee and the newspaper. Nobody who knew us. Nobody who'd recognize the mayor's daughter from Millbrook or care about Roy Cooper's kid.

Elizabeth climbed off the Indian and took off the helmet, her hair wild from the wind. She was grinning.

"That never gets old," she said. "The speed. The freedom. I could ride forever."

"Careful. I might take you up on that."

"Promise?"

I took her hand—easy and natural in a way it couldn't be in Millbrook—and we walked into the diner together.

The waitress was middle-aged with kind eyes and an order pad. She led us to a booth by the window, handed us menus, promised to be right back for our drink orders.

Elizabeth slid into the red vinyl booth across from me, still smiling. "This is nice. Normal. Like we're just two people on a date instead of—"

"Instead of what we actually are?"

"Yeah." Her smile faded slightly. "Do you ever wish we could just be normal? That we'd met different? At school or church or somewhere regular?"

I thought about it. About meeting Elizabeth without the weight of our names, our histories, the railroad tracks that divided everything. It would've been easier. Simpler.

But would it have been this?

"No," I said. "Because then you wouldn't be you and I wouldn't be me. We'd just be two people going through motions. This matters because it's hard. Because we're choosing it anyway."

Her smile returned, softer. "When did you get so wise?"

"I'm not wise. Just stubborn."

The waitress came back and we ordered—burgers and fries for both of us, chocolate milkshakes because Elizabeth said we had to since this was a real date. When the waitress left, Elizabeth leaned forward, elbows on the table.

"Tell me something I don't know about you," she said. "Something real."

"You know pretty much everything. My dad. The garage. My dreams about custom bikes."

"There's got to be more. Favorite color. Worst fear. Secret talent." She was watching me with those blue-gray eyes, genuinely curious. "Anything."

I thought about it. "I read."

"What?"

"Books. I read books. Not just mechanics manuals. Real books. Novels and stuff." It felt strange admitting it out loud. "Library's two blocks from the garage. I go there sometimes on lunch breaks. Check out books. Read them at night when Ma's asleep and the house is quiet."

Elizabeth's eyes lit up. "What kind of books?"

"Whatever they've got. Adventure stories mostly. Westerns. Sometimes detective novels. Anything where the guy gets to be more than he started as." I looked at my hands on the table. "Probably sounds stupid."

"It doesn't sound stupid. It sounds wonderful." She reached across and touched my hand. "What are you reading now?"

"Shane. It's a Western. About a gunfighter trying to leave his past behind, start over somewhere new. But the past keeps finding him, no matter how far he rides."

"Do you see yourself in that? Trying to outrun your past?"

"Maybe. Or maybe I just like the idea that people can be more than one thing. That the gunfighter can also be the good guy. That your history doesn't have to be your destiny."

The waitress brought our milkshakes—tall glasses with whipped cream and cherries. Elizabeth took a sip, thoughtful.

"I wanted to be a teacher," she said suddenly. "When I was little, before my mother died. I used to line up my dolls and teach them lessons. Reading and arithmetic. My mother said I'd be wonderful at it."

"You would be. You're patient. Smart. Good at explaining things."

"My father says teaching is fine for women who need to work, but I don't need to work. I need to be a good wife to someone important, support his career, raise respectable children." Her voice was flat. "Teaching isn't part of that plan."

"What if you did it anyway?"

"Just became a teacher? Against his wishes?"

"Why not? You're going to college. You could study education. Get certified. Teach."

"You make it sound easy."

"I didn't say easy. I said possible." I took a drink of my milkshake—thick and cold and perfect. "You told me I should chase my dreams. Build custom bikes. Leave Millbrook. Why can't you do the same?"

"Because I'm the mayor's daughter. I have responsibilities. Expectations."

"Says who? Your father? The town?" I leaned forward. "What about what you say? What you want?"

She was quiet for a long moment, turning her milkshake glass in her hands. "I don't know if I'm brave enough to disappoint him. To choose what I want over what he needs me to be."

"You're brave enough to be here with me. To keep coming back even though it's risky. To call me on my fear when I tried to push you away." I caught her eyes. "You're braver than you think, Elizabeth."

"So are you."

"We're quite a pair then. Both of us too scared to chase what we want but somehow brave enough to chase each other."

She laughed, and the sound made something warm bloom in my chest. "That's exactly what we are."

Our burgers came, and we ate and talked about books and dreams and all the places we'd never been but wanted to go. Elizabeth had never been further than Indianapolis. I'd never left Indiana. The world felt huge and impossible and maybe, just maybe, within reach if we were crazy enough to try.

"California," Elizabeth said, stealing a fry from my plate. "I want to see the Pacific Ocean. Stand on a beach and look out at nothing but water and sky."

"I want to see Chicago. The custom bike shops there. Learn from people who really know the craft."

"We could do both. Drive out west, stop in Chicago on the way back."

"On what money?"

"We'll save up. Work. Save every dollar." Her eyes were bright with possibility. "It doesn't have to be right away. But someday, Jake. We could actually do it."

Someday. The word felt dangerous and wonderful. Like maybe the future could be more than Millbrook and the garage and the life everyone expected.

"Yeah," I said. "Someday."

We finished our burgers and split a slice of apple pie because Elizabeth said you couldn't have a proper diner date without pie. The afternoon sun slanted through the window, warm on our booth, and for a couple of hours we were just Jake and Elizabeth, two people on a date, no history or expectations or impossible obstacles.

Just us.

When we finally left, Elizabeth grabbed my hand in the parking lot and pulled me close.

"Thank you," she said.

"For lunch? Pretty sure you paid half."

"For this. For being here. For letting me be normal for a little while." She kissed me, right there in the parking lot where anyone could see, and it tasted like chocolate and apples and hope.

We climbed back on the Indian and headed toward Millbrook as the afternoon stretched into evening. The wind rushed past us, Elizabeth's arms tight around my waist, and I thought about futures that didn't have to be written yet. About California beaches and Chicago shops and teaching kids who needed someone patient and smart.

About maybe being brave enough to choose what we wanted instead of what we were supposed to want.

The sun was setting when we reached the quarry—our place, where we could be ourselves without watching eyes. I pulled off the road and killed the engine, and we sat on the limestone edge watching the water turn gold and orange and red.

"I don't want this day to end," Elizabeth said quietly.

"It doesn't have to. Not yet."

She leaned against me, and I wrapped my arm around her shoulders. The quarry water reflected the sunset, doubling its beauty, and stars started appearing overhead one by one.

"Jake?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm glad you didn't run. At the quarry last week when you tried to end things. I'm glad you stayed."

"Me too."

"Whatever happens—with my father, with the town, with everything—I want you to know this matters. You matter."

I kissed the top of her head. "You matter too."

We stayed until full dark, talking about nothing and everything, and when we finally left to take Elizabeth home, I felt different. Lighter. Like maybe the weight I'd been carrying since I was ten years old didn't have to define me forever.

Like maybe I could be more than Roy Cooper's kid.

Maybe I could just be Jake.
