# Chapter 2: She Walks In

I was under the Hendersons' Chevrolet when I heard footsteps that didn't belong.

You learn sounds in a garage. Heavy work boots meant Sam. Quick strides meant men who knew machinery. Hesitant shuffles meant customers out of their depth. These footsteps were different—the click of heels on concrete, light and careful.

I rolled out from under the Chevy, wiping my hands on a rag that just redistributed the grease. The bay doors were open, afternoon light pouring in, and standing in that brightness was a girl who definitely wasn't in the right place.

She was backlit at first, silhouetted by June sun. A dress with a fitted waist, skirt below her knees—the kind of outfit you'd wear to church. Not the kind anyone wore to Sam's Garage.

I stood up, tossed the rag onto the workbench, and she stepped further inside.

Pretty didn't cover it, though that was the first word my brain offered before I shut that thinking down hard. Dark hair pulled back, the kind that looked soft and probably smelled like flowers. Her dress was light blue with a white collar and pearl buttons. She wore actual pearls at her throat and white gloves.

White gloves in a garage.

I felt every smudge of grease on my hands, every stain on my t-shirt. I stood there feeling like exactly what I was—east side trash in the presence of someone who mattered.

She looked at me with eyes darker than her dress, some color between blue and gray. Those eyes swept over me once—quick assessment, the kind everyone made when they first saw Roy Cooper's kid—and then she smiled.

Not a fake smile. An actual smile that reached her eyes and made something in my chest stutter.

"Hello," she said. Her voice was clear, educated, the kind of diction they taught in good schools. "I'm looking for Sam Henderson? My father's car was towed here earlier."

Of course. Mayor Hayes's Buick. I should've put it together—the dress, the pearls, the way she stood like someone who'd never had to apologize for taking up space.

"Sam's in the office," I managed, jerking my thumb toward the back. "I can get him."

"Thank you." She stepped further into the garage, and I caught the scent of her perfume cutting through the oil and solvent smell. Something light and floral that had no business existing in the same space as engine grease. "Is that my father's car?"

She nodded toward the '55 Buick Special sitting in the second bay, hood already open, engine exposed like a patient on an operating table.

"Yeah. Towed in this morning."

"Do you know what's wrong with it?"

I hesitated. Sam handled the customer interactions. I just fixed the cars. That was the arrangement, the one that kept me from having to make small talk with people who'd cross the street to avoid me anywhere else. But she was looking at me with genuine curiosity, waiting for an answer like my opinion mattered.

"Won't know for sure until I diagnose it," I said, keeping my voice professional, neutral. "Could be fuel pump. Could be ignition. Need to check a few things."

"How long will that take?"

"Day or two. Maybe three if we need to order parts."

She nodded slowly, taking this in like it was important information instead of the routine timeline I gave every customer. "My father needs it fairly soon. He has meetings, appointments..."

"We'll do our best." The words came out flat, automatic. I'd said them a thousand times.

Something flickered across her face—disappointment maybe, or frustration, I couldn't tell. She glanced around the garage, taking in the tools on the walls, the cars in various states of repair, the calendar from the auto parts supplier still showing May because no one had bothered to flip it to June.

"You work here?" she asked.

"Yeah."

"What's your name?"

The question caught me off guard. Customers didn't ask my name. They asked for Sam, negotiated prices, picked up their cars, and left. I was the invisible grease monkey in the background, the set of hands that fixed things but didn't need acknowledging.

"Jake," I said after a pause. "Jake Cooper."

Recognition flashed in those eyes. Of course. Cooper. Roy Cooper's kid. Everyone in Millbrook knew that name and exactly what it meant—deadbeat, drunk, walked out on his family and left debts all over town. She probably knew all about it, heard it discussed at her father's dinner table like a cautionary tale.

But she didn't flinch. Didn't let her smile slip or take a step back like I might be contagious.

"I'm Elizabeth Hayes," she said, like I didn't already know, like she needed to introduce herself properly. "Thank you for working on my father's car, Jake. I know he'll appreciate it."

She said my name. Used it naturally, like it was just a name and not a mark against me. That weird feeling in my chest got worse.

Sam emerged from the office then, wiping his hands and putting on his customer-service face—still gruff but marginally less so than his working face. "Miss Hayes. Your father called about the Buick."

"Yes." Elizabeth turned her attention to Sam, and I felt the absence of her gaze like a physical thing. "I wanted to check on it personally. Make sure there's nothing we can do to expedite the repair."

Sam launched into his standard speech about diagnostics and parts availability and doing quality work right instead of fast work wrong. I should've gone back to the Chevy, gotten back under it, let Sam handle this like we always did.

Instead I stood there, not quite looking at her but aware of every movement. The way she listened to Sam with complete attention, nodding at the right moments. The way her gloved hands folded together in front of her, neat and composed. The way she glanced at the Buick's engine once, twice, like she was actually interested in what was wrong with it instead of just when she could have it back.

"Jake will handle the diagnosis," Sam was saying. "He's my best mechanic."

Best mechanic. Only mechanic. But I appreciated Sam saying it anyway.

Elizabeth looked back at me, and I forced myself to meet her eyes this time. "I'm sure it's in good hands," she said.

Those hands were currently covered in grease and motor oil, nails permanently stained no matter how hard I scrubbed. I shoved them in my coverall pockets and nodded once. "I'll take care of it."

"Thank you." She said it to me, not Sam. Then to both of us: "Please call when it's ready. My father will arrange to pick it up."

Sam nodded. "Will do, Miss Hayes."

She turned to leave, heels clicking on concrete in that same careful rhythm, heading back toward the rectangle of June sunlight and the respectable world beyond the garage bay doors. She paused at the threshold, looked back once.

"It was nice to meet you, Jake."

Then she was gone, stepping into the brightness and disappearing like she'd been a mirage conjured by too much time under hot engines in humid weather.

The garage felt emptier with her gone. Louder somehow, though nothing had changed except her absence. The same tools hung on the same walls. The same oil stains marked the same concrete. The same work waited in the same bays.

But something felt different.

"You gonna stand there all day or you gonna finish the Hendersons' Chevy?" Sam's voice cut through my thoughts, amused but pointed.

"Finishing it." I grabbed the creeper and dropped back down, rolling under the car where I belonged.

Sam's boots thudded away, back toward the office, and I reached for the socket wrench I'd left by the oil pan. Work. Focus. The Chevy needed an oil change and new filter, basic maintenance that didn't require thinking. Good. I didn't want to think.

But I couldn't stop thinking about how she'd asked my name. Used it. Looked at the Buick's engine like she actually cared what was broken. Stood in this garage in her blue dress and pearls and hadn't looked at me like trash, not even once.

I tightened the drain plug harder than necessary.

Just the mayor's daughter being polite. Well-mannered. Probably raised to say thank you and make eye contact when addressing the help. That's what I was—the help. The east-side grease monkey who fixed things for west-side people.

So why couldn't I stop thinking about the way she'd said my name?

I finished the oil change, lowered the Chevy off the lift, started on the brake job Sam had lined up next. Work made sense in a way people never did. You followed the manual, torqued the bolts to spec, and everything worked.

But Elizabeth Hayes had looked at me like I was a person, not a reputation.

And that was dangerous.

It made me wonder—just for a second—what it would be like if the tracks didn't matter. If Cooper wasn't a name people whispered about. If a girl in pearls and a greaser in coveralls could exist in the same world.

I shook my head, focused on the brake caliper.

Stupid thoughts. Dangerous thoughts.

She was the mayor's daughter. I was Roy Cooper's kid. That was all there was to it.

I told myself that for the rest of the afternoon, right up until closing when I climbed on my Indian and rode back across the tracks toward the side of town where I belonged.

But I could still hear her voice saying my name.

And that was a problem I didn't know how to fix.
