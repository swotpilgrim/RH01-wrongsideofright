# Chapter 16: Admission

The quarry's quiet except for crickets and the occasional splash of a fish breaking the surface. Elizabeth's beside me on the limestone edge, her hand in mine, warm and small. Stars are coming out overhead, reflected in the dark water like scattered diamonds. Been here dozens of times, but tonight feels different. Heavier.

I've been trying to keep these words locked inside for days. Told myself it was safer that way. But they're burning through my chest, demanding out, and I can't hold them back anymore.

"Jake?" Elizabeth's voice is soft. "You're awfully quiet tonight."

I am. Been that way since we got here twenty minutes ago, just sitting and holding her hand like some scared kid who forgot how to talk. My heart's hammering against my ribs hard enough I'm surprised she can't hear it.

"I need to tell you something," I say, and my voice comes out rougher than I meant it to.

She shifts to look at me, her face half in shadow, half in the dying light. "Okay."

It should be easy. Three words. But I've never said them before, not like this, not when they're true enough to terrify me. Everything in me wants to chicken out, make a joke. But I can't.

"Elizabeth, I—" The words stick in my throat. I try again. "I love you."

The silence that follows feels endless. Elizabeth goes completely still, doesn't even seem to be breathing. I can't look at her, can't stand to see whatever's on her face—pity or shock or worse.

"What did you say?" Her voice is barely a whisper.

Now I do look at her, force myself to meet her eyes. "I love you. I'm in love with you. Have been for weeks, maybe. Since that first time you showed up at the garage."

Tears are welling up in her eyes, catching the starlight. My stomach drops. This is it. This is where she tells me she cares about me but doesn't feel the same way, that I'm reading too much into whatever this is between us.

"You love me?" Her voice breaks on the words.

"Yeah." I have to clear my throat. "I know I got no right to. I know I shouldn't. You deserve someone who can—"

"I love you too."

The words hit me like a fist to the chest. I stare at her, sure I heard wrong, but she's crying for real now, tears spilling down her cheeks, and she's smiling.

"What?"

"I love you, Jake Cooper." She's laughing and crying at the same time. "I've loved you for weeks and I didn't know if you—I thought maybe you just liked kissing me or spending time together, but I didn't know if you felt the same—"

I kiss her before she can finish, pull her against me hard. She kisses me back with an intensity that makes every other kiss feel like practice. Her hands are in my hair, mine on her waist, and everything else—the town, her father, my reputation—disappears until there's just this. Just us.

When we finally break apart we're both breathing hard. I rest my forehead against hers, my eyes closed, trying to memorize this exact moment because part of me still can't believe it's real.

"Say it again," I whisper.

"I love you." Her hands are on my face now, her thumbs brushing my cheekbones. "I love you, I love you, I love you."

Each repetition makes it more real and more terrifying. Because loving each other doesn't change anything about why this won't work. If anything, it makes it worse—makes the stakes impossibly higher.

"Elizabeth." I pull back enough to look at her properly. "What are we gonna do?"

Her smile fades a little. She knows what I mean. We can't keep meeting in secret forever. Can't pretend we're just friends when we're around town, then come out here and be whatever we really are. Eventually someone's gonna notice. Eventually her father's gonna find out for real, not just suspect.

"I don't know," she says quietly. "But we'll figure it out."

"Your father's gonna kill me when he finds out."

"He's not going to kill you." But she doesn't sound completely convinced.

I take her hands in mine—her fingers so much smaller, her skin soft where mine's calloused and stained with grease. The difference between us is right there. Mayor's daughter and mechanic's apprentice.

"I gotta find a way to be worthy of you," I say.

"Jake—"

"No, listen." I need to say this. "I gotta build something. Prove I'm not just some punk kid going nowhere. Your father's gotta see I can be something more than what everyone expects."

"You're already worthy." Her voice is fierce. "You think I care about what you can provide? What my father thinks? You're the only person who sees me, Jake. The real me. You see me, and you treat me like my thoughts matter. That makes you worthy."

"The world doesn't work that way, Elizabeth." I wish it did. God, I wish it did. "Your father isn't gonna care that I see you. He's gonna care that I got nothing to offer you except trouble and a reputation I can't shake."

"Then we'll change his mind."

"How?"

She's quiet for a minute, staring out across the quarry water. When she speaks again, her voice is smaller. "I don't know. But I know I'm not giving you up. I can't—" Her voice breaks. "Jake, I love you. I love you and I don't care what anyone thinks about it."

I pull her against my chest, hold her like she's the only solid thing in a spinning world. Maybe she is.

"I love you too," I say into her hair. "That's why I gotta do this right. I gotta become someone your father can't dismiss. Someone the town can't write off. I don't know how yet, but I will."

"You don't have to do it alone." She pulls back to look at me. "We're in this together now. Partners."

Partners. The word settles into my chest, warm and terrifying and right. I've never been anyone's partner before. Never had someone choose me, choose to stand beside me instead of expecting me to prove myself first.

"Partners," I repeat.

She nods. "So we figure it out together. Whatever comes next."

"Your father's gonna make it hard."

"I know."

"People are gonna talk. They're gonna say things about you, about us. Once folks know, you can't take it back. Your reputation—"

"Is mine to risk." Her jaw's set in that stubborn way that makes me love her even more. "I'm not a child, Jake. I know what I'm choosing."

But does she? Does she really understand what it means to be with someone like me? The gossip, the judgment, the way people will look at her differently once they know she's involved with Roy Cooper's kid?

"I'm scared," I admit. The words come out before I can stop them. "I'm scared I'm gonna mess this up. That I'm gonna let you down or—or become like my old man and ruin everything good. I'm scared I'm not strong enough to be what you need."

"Jake." She cups my face in her hands, makes me look at her. "You're the strongest person I know. You've been taking care of yourself and your mother since you were ten. You work harder than anyone, you're loyal to your friends, you're honest even when it costs you. You're nothing like your father."

"How do you know?" The question comes out raw. "How do you know I won't—"

"Because I know you." Her voice is absolutely certain. "I've watched you. I've seen how you treat people, how you take responsibility, how you show up every day and do the work even when it's hard. Your father ran when things got difficult. You stay. That's the difference."

I want to believe her. God, I want to believe her so badly it hurts. Maybe she's right. Maybe I'm not doomed to repeat his mistakes just because I've got his name and his reputation following me around.

"I'm gonna try," I say. "I'm gonna try to be worthy of you, Elizabeth. Even if it takes years. Even if I gotta work three jobs and save every penny and prove myself to every person in this town, I'm gonna do it."

"I know you will." She kisses me softly. "And I'll be right here beside you."

We sit there longer, her against my shoulder, my arm around her waist, both staring up at the stars. The future feels impossible and terrifying, but for the first time, it also feels possible. Like maybe, just maybe, we can figure this out together.

"We should probably head back," Elizabeth says eventually. "It's getting late."

"Yeah." But neither of us moves.

"Jake?"

"Hmm?"

"I'm glad you told me." Her voice is soft. "That you love me. I'm glad we're not hiding it anymore. From each other, at least."

"Me too." I press a kiss to the top of her head. "Scariest thing I've ever done, but me too."

We stand up, brush limestone dust off our clothes. I help her down the rocky path to where we left my motorcycle. The ride back to town is slower than usual, like both of us are trying to stretch out this moment, this bubble where it's just us and nothing else matters.

When I drop her off two blocks from her house—close enough to walk but far enough that nobody's gonna see my bike outside the mayor's place—she kisses me one more time.

"I love you," she whispers against my lips.

"I love you too."

I watch her walk away until she disappears around the corner, then sit there on my idling motorcycle for another minute, trying to process what just happened. Elizabeth Hayes loves me. Loves me. The mayor's daughter, the smartest, prettiest, best girl in Millbrook, loves me.

And I have absolutely no idea how we're gonna make this work.

But we're gonna try. We have to. Because now that I've said those words, now that she's said them back, there's no going back to before. We've crossed some invisible line, made promises with our admissions even if we didn't speak them out loud.

I kick the motorcycle into gear and head home through the quiet streets, my heart simultaneously lighter and heavier than it's ever been. Love should make you invincible, shouldn't it? Should make you feel like you can take on the world.

But all I feel is vulnerable. More vulnerable than I've ever been in my life. Because now I've got something to lose. Something—someone—who matters more than anything.

And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let anything take her away from me.
