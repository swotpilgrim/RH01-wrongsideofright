# Chapter 12: She Won't Let Go

Saturday came with perfect weather—warm sun, clear skies, the kind of day that made you believe good things were possible.

Elizabeth's father left for Indianapolis at eight in the morning. She called the garage from a pay phone at nine to confirm he was gone.

"He won't be back until late tonight," she said, excitement clear in her voice. "We really get a whole day."

"I'll pick you up at ten," I said. "Block from your house like before?"

"Actually—can I meet you at the garage? I want to see where you work when I'm not there. Your world."

My world. Sam's Garage with its oil stains and half-dismantled engines and the perpetual smell of gasoline and metal. Not exactly romantic.

"It's just a garage, Elizabeth."

"It's where you spend most of your time. That makes it important." Her voice was firm. "I want to see it. Really see it."

So at ten o'clock I was wiping down my workbench when her Chevrolet pulled in. Saturday meant the garage was closed, the lot empty except for my Indian and a Buick waiting for parts. Quiet. Private.

Elizabeth climbed out wearing a light summer dress, yellow with small flowers, her hair pulled back in a ponytail. She looked fresh and bright against the garage's grease and grime—like sunshine walking into shadow.

"Hi," she said, smiling that smile that made my chest tight.

"Hi." I walked over, and she kissed me quick—still new enough to make my heart race, to make me forget for a second where we were. "You sure you want the tour? It's not much to see."

"Stop apologizing for your life," she said gently. "Show me."

I showed her the main work area where I spent most days. The tool chest I'd organized exactly how I liked it. The lift system for raising cars. The parts shelves where everything had its place because Sam was strict about organization.

She asked questions about everything. How the lift worked. What different tools were for. Why we had three different sizes of the same wrench.

"You really love this," she observed, watching me explain the torque wrench calibration.

"It's just work."

"No it's not. Your whole face changes when you talk about it." She touched the workbench. "This is where you taught me about engines. Where I learned I could do things I thought I couldn't."

"That was all you. I just showed you where the parts were."

"You made me feel capable. That matters." She walked over to where my sketches were pinned above the bench—motorcycle designs I'd been working on. "Can I look at these?"

I'd never shown anyone those sketches except Sam. They were private. Dreams that felt too big to say out loud.

"They're just ideas. Nothing serious."

She studied them anyway, careful and focused. Running her fingers over the pencil lines showing frame modifications and custom details.

"These are beautiful, Jake. Really beautiful." She looked at me. "This is what you want to build? Custom motorcycles?"

"Someday. Maybe. If I ever save enough money and find someone willing to take a chance on me." I shrugged, uncomfortable. "Probably just fantasy."

"Why do you do that?"

"Do what?"

"Dismiss your dreams before anyone else can. Call them fantasy, nothing serious, just ideas." She turned to face me fully. "You're talented. These designs are good. Why can't you believe that?"

"Because guys like me don't get to build custom bikes for rich clients. We fix transmissions and change oil and if we're lucky we keep a roof over our heads."

"Says who?"

"Says reality. Says every person who's ever looked at me and seen Roy Cooper's kid before they saw me."

Elizabeth stepped closer. "I see you. Not your father. You."

"I know. That's—" I struggled for words. "That's why this matters so much. Why it scares me so much."

"Tell me about him." She took my hand. "Your father. You never talk about him except to say you're not like him. What happened?"

I didn't want to talk about this. Didn't want to dredge up the anger I'd been carrying since I was ten years old. But Elizabeth was looking at me with those blue-gray eyes, and she'd asked about my world. My father was part of that world whether I wanted him to be or not.

"He left when I was ten," I said. "Just walked out one day and never came back. No note. No goodbye. Ma came home from work and found me alone with a mostly empty closet and his wedding ring on the kitchen table."

"Oh, Jake."

"The worst part wasn't that he left. It was knowing why." I looked at our joined hands instead of at her. "He couldn't handle it. The responsibility. Being a husband and father. Working dead-end jobs to pay rent. He wanted freedom more than he wanted us. Wanted it bad enough to walk away from everything."

I could still remember that day. Coming home from school to an empty house, thinking he was at work. Waiting. Making myself a sandwich because I was hungry. Then Ma coming home and seeing his closet, and the way her face just crumbled.

"I promised myself I'd never be like him," I said. "Never walk away from something hard. Never choose easy over right."

"That wasn't your fault."

"I know that. But the town doesn't know that. They see Cooper and they see a man who walked out on his family. Who proved he was worthless. And they assume I'll do the same."

"But you won't."

"How do you know? Maybe I've got his coward blood. Maybe I'll run when things get hard." I met her eyes. "Maybe I almost did. At the quarry. When I tried to end things."

"But you didn't run. You stayed. You chose to be brave even though it scared you." She squeezed my hand. "That's the opposite of what he did."

I wanted to believe that. Wanted to think I was different, better, capable of sticking when things got difficult.

"Tell me about your mother," I said. "You mentioned she died five years ago."

Elizabeth's face changed, grief and something else flickering across it. "Cancer. It was fast—six months from diagnosis to funeral. I was twelve."

"I'm sorry."

"My father couldn't handle it either. Not like your father—he didn't leave. But he disappeared into work, into politics, into building this perfect image of her that didn't quite match who she really was." She walked over to sit on one of the work stools, and I sat beside her. "She loved reading and gardening and terrible puns. She'd sneak me cookies before dinner and let me stay up late when Father was traveling. She was real and imperfect and wonderful."

"Your father doesn't remember her that way?"

"He remembers a saint. The perfect political wife, the ideal mother, the woman who never raised her voice or had a hair out of place." Elizabeth's voice was tight. "And he expects me to become her. This perfect version that never existed."

"That's impossible."

"I know. But he doesn't see that. He sees the mayor's daughter who'll marry well and continue the legacy." She looked at me. "Do you know what it's like to spend every day trying to be someone you're not? Someone who never even existed in the first place?"

I thought about being Roy Cooper's kid. About the expectations that came with that name—that I'd be worthless, irresponsible, a failure. About how every mistake confirmed what people already believed.

"Yeah," I said. "I know exactly what that's like."

"We're both trapped, aren't we? You by who your father was. Me by who my mother wasn't." She reached for my hand again. "Maybe that's why this feels so real. When I'm with you, I don't have to pretend. I can just be."

"Same," I admitted. "You don't look at me and see my last name. You see—I don't know. Me, I guess. Whoever that is."

"Someone worth knowing. Someone worth choosing." She leaned closer. "Someone brave enough to try even when it's terrifying."

"I'm not that brave."

"You are. You just don't believe it yet." She kissed me, soft and sweet, and for a minute the garage fell away—the oil stains and tool benches and sketches of impossible dreams.

When we pulled apart, she rested her forehead against mine. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For letting me see your world. For telling me about your father. For trusting me with the real stuff." She pulled back to look at me. "We should probably go if we're going to make it to that diner."

"Yeah. But Elizabeth?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you too. For seeing me. For not running when you learned who my father was, what people think about me."

"I told you. I see you, not him. That's not going to change."

We left the garage and climbed on my Indian, Elizabeth's arms around my waist, and headed out of Millbrook toward the diner two towns over. The road stretched ahead of us, empty and full of possibility, and for the first time in my life I let myself believe that maybe the future didn't have to be what everyone expected.

Maybe it could be what we chose.
