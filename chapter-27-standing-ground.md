# Chapter 27: Standing Ground

The parade's supposed to start soon but nobody's moving. The whole square's frozen, watching us.

Mayor Hayes doesn't try to stop us. But as we pass, he says—loud enough for nearby people to hear—"This conversation isn't finished."

Elizabeth stops. "Then let's finish it."

"Elizabeth—"

"No, Dad. You said this isn't over. Fine. Let's talk about it. Right here. Right now." She turns to face him, and I'm forced to turn with her. "Or were you planning to wait until we're home so you can threaten and manipulate in private again?"

The nearby crowd shifts closer.

Mayor Hayes's jaw clenches. "You're making a scene."

"You taught me how." Elizabeth's voice is steady. "Every town hall meeting, every campaign speech. You taught me to work a crowd. I'm just using what you taught me."

His face flushes. "This is family business."

"You made it public when you threatened Jake's mother's job. When you went to Sam's Garage to blackmail a teenager."

More gasps from the crowd. This'll be all over town—except the whole town's already watching.

"I did what I thought was necessary to protect you," Mayor Hayes says tightly.

"From what? From someone who loves me? From being happy?" Elizabeth shakes her head. "I'm not a child anymore, Dad. And I'm not a campaign prop. I'm a person. And I'm choosing Jake."

"Elizabeth, come with me." It's not a request. "Now."

"No."

The word rings across the square. Elizabeth stands beside me and doesn't move.

The mayor's eyes cut to me. "You. Stay away from my daughter."

My mouth goes dry. This is it. The moment I either stand up or prove I'm the coward he thinks I am.

Elizabeth's courage has changed something in me. I can't let her fight alone.

"With respect, sir," I say. My voice comes out rougher than I want but steady. "I love Elizabeth. And I'm not walking away just because it's inconvenient for you."

The crowd makes a sound—shock, approval, I can't tell. But Mayor Hayes's face goes red.

"Inconvenient?" His voice rises. "You have nothing. No education, no prospects. You work in a garage for forty dollars a week. Your father was the town drunk who abandoned his family." He turns to the crowd. "This young man has nothing to offer my daughter but poverty and scandal."

Every word is true. Every word hurts. But I don't drop Elizabeth's hand.

"You're right," I say. "I don't have much. My father left us with nothing but debts and a bad name. I work in a garage. I rent a house with my mother."

Mayor Hayes's expression says he's won. Proven his point.

"But I'm working toward better," I continue. "I've been saving money. Learning everything I can from Sam. And I've got a dream—to build custom motorcycles. Create something of my own." The words come faster. "It's going to take years. But I've got a plan. Been drawing designs, researching, saving every spare dollar."

The crowd's attention shifts. They're listening.

"That's a fantasy," Mayor Hayes says dismissively. "A boy's daydream."

"Maybe. But it's my daydream. And I'm willing to work for it. Every day. Every hour." I look at Elizabeth, then back at her father. "You think I've got nothing to offer. But I can offer effort. Loyalty. Love. I can offer to work myself to the bone to build something worth having. That's not nothing."

"It's not enough."

"Says who?" The words come out harder than I intend. "Who decides what's enough? You? Or does Elizabeth get a say?"

"I'm her father—"

"And you know what you want for her. That's not the same as what's best for her." I'm not backing down. "Elizabeth's standing here telling you she chose me. You're so busy protecting her from me you're not hearing what she wants."

"What she wants and what she needs are different."

"Then trust her to know the difference. She's smart enough. Brave enough." I glance at her. "She just stood in front of the whole town and told you to stop controlling her life. That takes courage."

Mayor Hayes looks at his daughter. Really looks at her. I can see him taking in her determined face, her tears, the way she's holding my hand like she'll never let go.

"Jake's the best mechanic I've ever trained."

The voice comes from the crowd. Sam stepping forward. "And I've been doing this forty years. Kid's got real talent. He's honest, works hard, never complains."

The mayor stares at Sam. "You're biased—"

"I'm telling the truth. Give Jake five years and he'll have his own business. He's got the skill and the drive." Sam looks at me. "Just needed someone to see it in him."

Something loosens in my chest.

"He's also the most loyal person I know."

Tommy steps forward, standing beside Sam. "Jake's been my best friend since we were kids. When my dad died, Jake was there every day. When I needed a job, he convinced Sam to hire me. When I screwed up with Linda, he helped me fix it." Tommy looks at the mayor. "He's got loyalty. That's worth more than money."

My throat's tight. Sam and Tommy backing me in front of everyone.

"And he has something else," Elizabeth says. "He sees me. Not as a prop or possession. As a person. He listens. Asks what I think. Treats me like my opinions matter." Her voice gets stronger. "My whole life, men have been telling me what to think, what to do. Jake's the only one who's ever just let me be myself. That's why I love him."

The crowd's silent. Mrs. Patterson's crying. Bobby Miller looks stunned.

Mayor Hayes looks around at the faces. At Sam and Tommy beside me. At his daughter holding my hand. At the crowd seeing him lose control.

"He could hurt you," the mayor says. Quieter. "What happens when this dream doesn't work out? When money gets tight?"

"Then we'll deal with it. Together. But you don't get to make that choice for me."

"I'm trying to protect you—"

"From what? From failing? From being hurt?" She steps closer. "You can't protect me from everything. Trying to is just pushing me away."

The mayor's silent. I can see the war in his face—fear and love and terror of losing control.

"That's my risk to take."

"And when people talk?"

"Let them."

"Do you trust me?" She waits. "Do you trust that I'm smart enough to know my own heart?"

The mayor looks at her. At the daughter who won't back down.

"I do," he says finally. Reluctantly. "But that doesn't mean I have to like this."

"I'm not asking you to like it. Just respect it."

His eyes cut to me. Sharp. "You hurt her, and you answer to me."

"Dad," Elizabeth interrupts. "Stop."

"Either you accept this or you don't. But the threats have to stop."

Mayor Hayes looks like he wants to argue. But he knows he's lost this battle.

"This isn't over," he says.

"No," Elizabeth agrees. "But maybe it can be different from here on."

The mayor nods once. Then turns and walks away through the parting crowd.

Not approval. But not prohibition either.

I'm shaking. I just stood up to Mayor Hayes in front of the entire town.

And I'm still standing.

"You okay?" Elizabeth asks softly.

"Terrified."

"Me too." She laughs. "That was insane."

"Your father's going to make our lives hell."

"Probably. But openly instead of in back rooms." She turns to me. "Thank you. For standing up for us. For not running away."

"You didn't give me much choice."

"I gave you every choice. But you stood with me." Her eyes are wet but she's smiling.

Sam claps me on the shoulder. "Proud of you, kid."

"Thought you were gonna pass out when you started talking about the motorcycle business," Tommy grins.

"I almost did."

"But you didn't. You stood your ground." Sam squeezes my shoulder. "That takes guts."

The crowd's starting to disperse. The parade's starting—I can hear the band warming up, see people drifting toward Main Street. But some folks stop as they pass. Mrs. Henderson touches my arm. "Your mother would be proud." Jim from the hardware store nods approval. Even Mrs. Patterson dabs her eyes and says, "That was the bravest thing I've seen in thirty years."

I don't know what to say. Just nod and try to keep my throat from closing up.

Elizabeth pulls me aside as the square empties. "You told everyone about the motorcycle business."

"Yeah."

"Tell me about it. The real details."

So I tell her. About the designs I've been sketching. The research into custom fabrication. The money I've been saving. The idea of building bikes that are part art, part machine. Something that's mine.

"How long have you been planning this?"

"Year, maybe. Since I realized I'm good at this."

"And you didn't tell me because—"

"Because I'm Roy Cooper's kid who fixes cars for forty bucks a week. What business do I have dreaming about a company?"

"Every business." She touches my face. "You just told the mayor and the whole town. Don't back down now. Not with me."

"I want to build something. For us. Something that proves your father wrong."

"Then let's make it happen." Simple. "We'll figure it out together."

"Elizabeth, it's going to take years. Money we don't have—"

"So we'll work for it. You're willing to work yourself to the bone. I am too." Her eyes are fierce. "We just stood up to my father in front of the entire town. We can do this too."

Looking at her face—brave and determined and sure—I believe her.

Maybe we can.
