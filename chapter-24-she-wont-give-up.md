# Chapter 24: She Won't Give Up

I'm torquing head bolts when I hear the Buick pull up.

My hands freeze. Two and a half weeks since I pushed her away. Sam's at lunch, Tommy's running parts. I'm alone.

Nowhere to hide.

Her footsteps echo. I don't turn around, just keep working.

"Jake."

Her voice hits like a physical thing. I force myself to keep working. "Sam's not here."

"I'm not here for Sam."

"Then you got the wrong garage." I move to the next bolt. My hands are shaking but I'm hoping she can't see.

"Jake, look at me."

"Busy."

"You've been busy for two and a half weeks. Every time I come here, you disappear. I'm done being patient."

"Nothing to talk about. I told you it's over."

"Look at me."

"Elizabeth—"

"Look. At. Me."

I set down the wrench. Turn. There she is in a pale yellow dress, arms crossed. Not hurt or sad. Determined. Angry.

"There," she says. "Was that so hard?"

I shrug, look past her shoulder at nothing. "Said what I needed to say. Nothing's changed."

"Everything's changed." She steps closer. I back up until I hit the workbench.

"You need to go home."

"No. Not until you actually listen."

"I'm not—"

"You've been hiding for two and a half weeks. Won't answer when I come here. Take the back way when you see me downtown. You're running while standing still."

It stings because it's true. "Don't got nothing to say."

"Then listen." She closes the distance. I've got nowhere to go. "I know what you're doing."

"I'm working on an engine."

"You're trying to protect me. By pushing me away, telling me you don't love me, making yourself into the bad guy so I'll move on." Her eyes are locked on mine. "I know, Jake. I see exactly what you're doing."

My jaw tightens. "You don't know anything."

"I know you're lying. I know you do love me, no matter what you said. I know you're scared and you think you're not good enough and you've convinced yourself that leaving me is some noble sacrifice." Her voice softens slightly. "And I know you're wrong."

"Your father—"

"I don't care what my father thinks."

"You should."

"He wants me to have the life he's chosen. That's different." She touches my arm. "I don't need you to protect me from yourself. I need you to trust that I know what I want."

"You want someone who can give you a future—"

"Someone who sees me. Who treats me like I'm more than just decoration. Someone exactly like you."

"I can't give you what you deserve."

"What do I deserve? Money? Status?" Her voice turns fierce. "Those things don't make someone worthy. Being honest does. Being kind. Seeing me for who I am. You're the only person who's ever done that."

"That's not enough."

"It's everything. The rest doesn't matter if the person doesn't see you. Care about you. Love you."

"Elizabeth—"

"Tell me the truth." Her eyes search mine. "Did my father threaten you?"

"What?"

"My father. Did he threaten you?"

I try to look away but she moves with me. "He made clear the reality."

"What did he say? Exactly."

"Doesn't matter."

"It matters to me."

I blow out a breath. "Said I should stay away. Said if I didn't, he'd make things difficult. For Sam, for me, for—"

"For who?"

"My mother. Said she works at Miller's. Implied he could make that difficult."

Her face goes white. Then red. "He threatened your mother?"

"He threatened everyone. Sam's business license, my job prospects, Ma's work. Said I could take a job in Gary and leave, or stay and watch everything crumble."

"He had no right." She paces, then back. "How dare he?"

"He's trying to protect you."

"By threatening the people you love? By forcing you to choose?" She's shaking with anger. "That's not protection. That's control. That's him deciding he knows better than us."

"He's not wrong about me not being good enough—"

"Stop." She grabs my shirt, pulls me closer. "Stop saying that. Stop letting him in your head. Stop letting the town and your father's reputation and everyone else's opinions tell you what you're worth. You are good enough. You are worthy. And you are not responsible for what your father did or what people think or any of it."

I can't look at her. Can't stand the faith in her eyes when I know the reality. "Your father can destroy everyone I care about."

"Then we'll deal with it."

"How? You're seventeen. I work in a garage. What power do we have against the mayor?"

"We have us. We have the truth. Eventually people will see he's wrong about you."

"And in the meantime, Sam loses his business? My mother loses her job?"

"My father's bluffing."

"You don't know that."

"I know him. I know he makes threats when he's scared. And you know what scares him? That I might actually be right about you. That I might actually know what I want. That he might lose control." She touches my face, makes me look at her. "He's not all-powerful, Jake. He's just scared."

"Scared people are dangerous."

"So are determined ones." Her thumb brushes my cheekbone. "And I'm determined. I'm not giving up on us just because my father threw a tantrum and made some threats."

"It's not a tantrum. It's real consequences."

"Maybe. But I'm willing to risk them. The question is, are you?"

I close my eyes. This is the choice her father offered me. Accept the consequences of being with her, or run. "I can't ask you to risk everything for me."

"You're not asking. I'm choosing." Her voice is soft now but no less fierce. "I choose you, Jake. Even if it costs me my father's approval. Even if the town gossips. Even if things get hard. I choose you."

"Why?" The word comes out broken. "Why would you do that? What's worth all that?"

"You are." Simple. Certain. "You're worth it. We're worth it. And I'm not walking away just because things got difficult."

"Your father will make your life hell."

"Let him try. I'm eighteen in three months. Then I'm legally an adult and he can't stop me from seeing whoever I want."

"Three months of him making you miserable—"

"Is worth it if it means being with you." She's crying now, tears tracking down her face, but her voice doesn't waver. "Don't you understand? Losing you is worse than anything my father could do. These past two and a half weeks without you have been the worst of my life. I'd rather fight with my father every day and have you than have his approval and lose you."

I want to believe her. Want to believe that love is enough, that we can fight this, that maybe there's a way through. But years of being Roy Cooper's kid, years of the town telling me I'm no good, years of knowing my place—they're all screaming that this is wrong. That I should take the out her father offered. That loving her means letting her go.

But looking at her face—determined and crying and absolutely certain—I can't make myself push her away again.

"If we do this," I say slowly, "it won't be easy. Your father's not gonna back down. The town's gonna talk. Things are gonna get worse before they get better."

"I know."

"You might end up regretting it. Might wake up one day and realize you threw away everything for someone who wasn't worth it."

"I won't." She wipes her eyes. "But even if I did, that would be my mistake to make. My choice. Not my father's, not yours. Mine."

"I could still mess it up. Could still let you down. Could still become exactly what everyone thinks I am."

"Or you could become exactly what I know you are." She takes my hands. "Someone brave enough to fight for what he wants. Someone strong enough to believe he deserves good things. Someone who sees me and loves me and trusts me to know my own mind."

"I'm scared," I admit. The words feel like surrender. "I'm scared of failing you. Of dragging you down. Of proving your father right."

"I'm scared too." Her grip tightens. "But I'm more scared of losing you. Of spending the rest of my life wondering what if. Of letting fear make my decisions instead of love."

Love. She keeps coming back to that word. Like it's enough. Like it can overcome everything else.

Maybe it can't. Probably it can't.

But looking at Elizabeth standing in Sam's Garage with tear-tracks on her face and determination in her eyes, refusing to give up on me even when I gave up on us—

Maybe it's worth finding out.

"Your father's gonna be furious," I say.

"Probably."

"Things are gonna get ugly."

"I know."

"I don't have any money. No prospects. No plan for how to fix any of this."

"We'll figure it out. Together."

Together. There's that word again. The one that terrifies me and gives me hope at the same time.

I pull her against me, bury my face in her hair, and let myself hold her for the first time in two and a half weeks. She wraps her arms around me and holds on tight, and I can feel her crying into my shirt but she's not letting go.

"I'm sorry," I whisper. "I'm sorry I pushed you away. Sorry I lied. Sorry I made you cry."

"Just don't do it again." Her voice is muffled against my chest. "Next time you're scared, talk to me. Don't make decisions for me. Trust me enough to let me choose."

"I'll try."

"That's all I'm asking." She pulls back to look at me. "We're in this together now. Really together. No more running, no more hiding. Agreed?"

"Agreed."

She kisses me then, and it feels like coming home after being lost. Like breathing after drowning. Like every terrible thing from the past two and a half weeks was worth it just to get to this moment.

When we finally break apart, she's smiling through her tears. "So what now?"

"Now..." I blow out a breath. "Now we figure out how to deal with your father."

"Together."

"Together," I agree.

It's not a solution. It's not even really a plan. But it's a start.

And for the first time since Mayor Hayes walked into this garage with his threats and ultimatums, I let myself believe that maybe—just maybe—we can find a way through this.

Not because it'll be easy. Not because the odds are in our favor.

But because Elizabeth won't give up.

And maybe that means I shouldn't either.
