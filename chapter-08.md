# Chapter 8: Seeing Each Other

The following Saturday, Elizabeth showed up after closing time.

I was putting tools away when I heard her Chevrolet pull in. Five-thirty—later than she'd ever come. I stepped out, and she climbed out looking different.

Not work pants. A sundress, pale yellow with white flowers, her hair loose around her shoulders. She looked nervous.

"Hi," she said.

"Hi. We didn't have a lesson scheduled."

"I know. I just—" She stopped, started again. "I'm tired of only seeing you in the garage. Of only talking about carburetors and oil changes. I thought maybe—if you're not busy—we could do something else?"

Every rational thought in my head said this was a bad idea. Maintenance lessons in the garage were one thing. We could justify those, explain them away if anyone asked. But Elizabeth showing up in a sundress asking to spend time together? That was something else entirely.

"What did you have in mind?"

"Could you take me for a ride? On your motorcycle?" She gestured to the Indian parked by the building. "You talk about it like she's freedom on two wheels. I want to know what that feels like."

I should say no. Should tell her this was crossing a line we couldn't uncross. Should remind her that being seen together outside the garage would start talk we couldn't stop.

"Roads outside town are pretty empty this time of evening," I heard myself say instead. "No one out there to see us."

Her face lit up. "Really?"

"Really. But you've never been on a motorcycle before, right?"

"Never."

"It's different from a car. You have to lean with me in the turns, keep your feet on the pegs, hold on tight." I walked to the Indian, grabbed the spare helmet I kept strapped to the seat. "And you wear this. Non-negotiable."

"Okay."

I helped her fasten the helmet—too big for her, but better than nothing—and swung onto the bike. The Indian roared to life, that familiar rumble I felt in my chest as much as heard. Elizabeth climbed on behind me, tentative at first, then her arms wrapped around my waist.

And just like that, everything changed.

I could feel her pressed against my back, her arms tight around me, her cheek against my shoulder. Could smell her perfume mixing with gasoline and leather. Every point where we touched felt electric, alive in a way that made it hard to think.

"Ready?" I called over the engine.

"Ready!"

I kicked off, easing out of the lot and onto Main Street. Started slow, letting Elizabeth get used to the movement, the lean of the bike, the way speed felt without car doors and windows between you and the world.

As we passed through town, I was hyper-aware of eyes that might be watching. Mrs. Henderson sweeping her porch. Mr. Patterson locking up his hardware store. Anyone who might see the mayor's daughter on the back of Jake Cooper's motorcycle and draw the obvious conclusions.

But then we crossed the town limit, and Millbrook fell away behind us.

The road opened up—two lanes of asphalt cutting through Indiana cornfields, the evening sun turning everything gold. I opened the throttle, and the Indian surged forward, wind whipping past us, speed thrumming through the engine into our bones.

Elizabeth's grip tightened, and I heard her laugh—pure joy, bright and free.

We rode for twenty minutes, following roads I knew by heart. Past farms with cows watching us pass. Through patches of woods where the air turned cool and smelled like green things growing. Along the ridge where you could see for miles, nothing but fields and sky and the open road ahead.

I'd ridden these roads a hundred times, but with Elizabeth's arms around me it felt new. Like I was seeing it through her eyes—the freedom of it, the escape, the possibility that existed outside Millbrook's expectations and judgment.

The old quarry sat a few miles outside town, abandoned since before I was born when the limestone had played out. It was just a big hole in the ground now, filled with spring water so clear you could see twenty feet down. Kids came here sometimes to swim or drink or make out, but on a Saturday evening it was usually empty.

I pulled off onto the dirt track leading to the quarry, killed the engine in the small clearing near the edge. Silence rushed in—just wind in the grass and birds settling for evening and Elizabeth's breathless laughter.

"That was amazing," she said, pulling off the helmet. Her hair was wild, her cheeks flushed, her eyes bright. "I've never felt anything like that."

"Freedom on two wheels."

"Exactly." She climbed off the bike, steadier than I expected. "Can we stay a while? Watch the sunset?"

We should go back. Should get her home before anyone noticed how long she'd been gone. But the sun was painting the sky orange and pink, and Elizabeth was looking at me like this moment mattered, and I couldn't make myself say no.

"Yeah. We can stay a while."

We walked to the quarry's edge where the limestone formed a natural ledge, and sat with our legs dangling over water that looked bottomless in the fading light. The sky stretched huge above us, no buildings or trees to interrupt it, just endless blue turning to fire.

"It's beautiful here," Elizabeth said.

"I come here sometimes when I need to think. Or not think." I picked up a piece of loose limestone, turned it over in my hands. "It's the only place in Millbrook where I don't feel like people are watching, judging."

"I know that feeling."

"Do you?"

"Everyone's always watching the mayor's daughter. Making sure I'm behaving properly, dressed appropriately, saying the right things. It's exhausting." She picked up her own piece of limestone. "Here, I don't have to be her. I can just... be."

We sat in comfortable silence, watching the sun sink toward the horizon. The quarry water reflected the sky, doubling the sunset, making it feel like we were suspended between two worlds.

"Thank you for this," Elizabeth said quietly. "For bringing me here. For showing me what freedom feels like."

"It's just a motorcycle ride."

"It's more than that." She looked at me, and in the golden light her eyes were more blue than gray, more open than guarded. "When I'm with you, I feel like I can breathe. Like I'm allowed to be real instead of perfect."

My chest tightened. "You are real. You've always been real."

"Not to most people. To them I'm a role to play. The mayor's daughter. The good girl. The acceptable choice." She turned the limestone over in her hands. "But you see me. Actually see me. Do you know how rare that is?"

I did know. Because she saw me too—not Roy Cooper's kid or the garage grease monkey, but Jake. Just Jake. With dreams and thoughts and worth beyond what the town had decided about me.

"Yeah," I said. "I know."

Her hand found mine on the limestone ledge. Just her fingers brushing mine, but the touch sent electricity up my arm. Neither of us pulled away.

"I think about you all week," she said, so quiet I almost didn't hear her. "Count the days until Saturday. Make up excuses to drive past the garage. I know it's foolish, I know we're from different worlds, but I can't help it."

"Elizabeth—"

"I know all the reasons this is impossible. My father. Your reputation. The town. The tracks that divide everything." She looked at our hands, almost touching but not quite. "But when I'm here with you, those reasons feel small. Temporary. Like maybe they don't have to matter."

I should tell her they did matter. Should explain that those reasons were real and permanent and bigger than both of us. Should protect her from the hurt that was coming because this couldn't end well.

But the sun was setting and her hand was warm near mine and I was tired of doing what I should.

"They don't have to matter," I said. "Not right now. Not here."

She smiled, and it was like sunrise and sunset happening at once—bright and hopeful and tinged with the knowledge that it couldn't last.

We watched the sun disappear, the sky shifting from gold to pink to deep purple. Stars started appearing, one by one, and the quarry water turned dark and mysterious below us.

"We should go back," Elizabeth finally said, though neither of us moved.

"Yeah."

We sat there a moment longer, hands not quite touching, the space between us charged with everything we weren't saying. Then Elizabeth stood, brushed limestone dust from her dress, and the moment broke.

The ride back was different from the ride out. The air had turned cool, the roads were empty, and Elizabeth held me tighter. Like she didn't want to let go. Like she knew what I knew—that returning to Millbrook meant returning to reality, to the roles we were supposed to play, to the walls between her world and mine.

I didn't take her to the garage. Drove into town on quiet residential streets, parked a block from her house where no one from the Hayes place would see my motorcycle.

We sat there in the gathering dark, engine ticking as it cooled, neither of us ready to end this.

"Thank you," Elizabeth said, still sitting behind me, arms still around my waist. "For tonight. For showing me the quarry."

"Any time."

"I should go. My father will wonder where I've been."

"What will you tell him?"

"That I went for a drive. To think." She slid off the bike, removed the helmet, handed it back to me. Her hair was completely wild now, her dress wrinkled, her cheeks still flushed from the wind. She looked beautiful and real and nothing like the perfect mayor's daughter.

"Elizabeth—"

She leaned down and pressed her hand against mine where it rested on the handlebar. Just for a second. Just long enough for the touch to burn itself into my memory.

"Same time next Saturday?" she asked.

"For a lesson?"

"For whatever we want it to be."

She walked away before I could answer, disappearing into the dusk toward her tree-lined street and the house where she was the mayor's daughter and I was nobody she should know.

I sat there on my motorcycle until I couldn't see her anymore, my hand still warm where she'd touched it.

This was dangerous. This was heading somewhere we couldn't come back from.

But when I thought about next Saturday, all I felt was anticipation.

I was in so much trouble.
