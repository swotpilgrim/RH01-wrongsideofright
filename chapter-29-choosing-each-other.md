# Chapter 29: Choosing Each Other

The parade's in full swing when Mayor Hayes finally leaves.

He gives us one last look—warning, resigned—before heading to his car. Elizabeth watches him go.

"He's going to make this difficult," she says.

"I know."

"But he gave us a chance."

"Yeah." I'm still processing that. The handshake. The conditional approval. "He did."

The crowd's mostly dispersed. But some are still watching us. Wondering what happens next.

I turn to Elizabeth, and suddenly I don't care who's watching.

I pull her into my arms right there on Main Street and kiss her.

A real kiss. The kind that says mine and yours and ours.

She makes a small sound of surprise, then kisses me back just as fiercely. Her hands fist in my shirt, and for a minute the whole world is just her.

When we finally pull apart, she's crying and laughing.

"You just kissed me in front of everyone," she says.

"Yeah."

"Jake Cooper, who hates being the center of attention."

"Don't care anymore." I wipe a tear from her cheek. "Let them watch."

She laughs, the sound bright and a little wild. "I can't believe you stood up to my father. I can't believe you told him about your plans. I can't believe you chose me despite everything you were afraid of."

"How could I not?" I rest my forehead against hers. "You chose me first. Every time. Even when I tried to push you away. Even when your father threatened me. Even when the whole town said you shouldn't."

"Because you're worth it."

"Elizabeth—"

"You are." She grips my face. "You're worth fighting for. Worth every bit of gossip and difficulty. Don't you see that?"

I don't. Not really. But looking at her face—fierce and certain—I want to believe it.

"Come on," I say. "Let's get out of here."

"Where?"

"The quarry. I need somewhere that's just ours."

She nods. We've been on display all day. I need somewhere quiet. Somewhere we can just be.

We walk to my motorcycle hand in hand. People watch us pass but I don't care. Just walk with Elizabeth like it's the most normal thing in the world.

The ride to the quarry takes ten minutes. Elizabeth holds on tight, her face pressed against my back.

The quarry's empty when we arrive. The sun's setting, painting the limestone cliffs in gold. The water's dark and still. Our place.

I park the motorcycle and we walk to the edge, sit down with our legs dangling over. Elizabeth leans against me and we just breathe for a minute.

"That really happened," she says finally. "All of it."

"Yeah."

"You told my father about your motorcycle business."

"I did."

"And he gave you a chance."

"A conditional one."

"Still a chance." She turns to look at me. "Jake, do you realize what you just did? You stood up to the mayor. Made promises in front of the whole town. Committed to building a future when you don't even know if it'll work."

"I know." The weight of it's starting to sink in. All those promises I made. About working hard and not becoming my father and building something worth having. "I'm terrified."

"Me too."

"Really? You don't look terrified."

"I'm very good at hiding it." She smiles slightly. "But yeah. I'm scared this won't work. That my father will find a reason to oppose it anyway. That the town will never really accept us. That we'll fail."

"Then why—"

"Because I'm more scared of not trying. Of spending my life wondering what if." She takes my hand, threads our fingers together. "And because I believe in us. In you. In what we can build together."

Together. That word again. The one that terrifies me and gives me hope.

"I don't know exactly how to do this," I admit. "Build a business. Live up to all those promises."

"Good thing you're not doing it alone."

"Elizabeth—"

"I'm serious. We're partners. You don't have to figure this all out by yourself." She shifts to face me. "Tell me what you need. What comes next."

"Sam said he'd help with the business side. He knows about licensing and suppliers. Tommy knows someone with garage space for rent—cheap, but big enough to work in. I've got designs for three bike models and a timeline for building the first one."

"How long?"

"Six months maybe? If I work nights and weekends while still pulling shifts at Sam's. Longer if I run into problems."

"What kind of problems?"

"Money for parts. Materials. Tools I don't have access to. My own inexperience building from scratch instead of just fixing what's broken." I shrug. "A hundred different ways it could fail."

"Or a hundred different ways to solve problems when they come up." She squeezes my hand. "I can help."

"You're going to college—"

"Not until next fall. That's nine months away. And even then, I'll be back on weekends and holidays." Her voice is firm. "I can help with research, with planning, with whatever you need. I'm good at organization. At making lists and tracking progress. Let me be part of this."

"Your father—"

"Said he'd give you a chance if you were serious. Me helping proves we're both serious. That we're building this together like we said."

I look at her in the fading light. At this girl who just stood up to her father in front of the entire town. Who's offering to help me build a business she's got no obligation to care about. Who keeps choosing me over and over even when it'd be easier not to.

"Okay," I say.

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Partners." I pull her closer. "We'll figure this out together."

She kisses me then, sweet and soft, and it tastes like promise. Like maybe all those things I said to her father could actually come true.

When we pull apart, the first fireworks are starting. Distant pops and colors lighting up the sky over Millbrook. The Fourth of July celebration continuing without us.

"We should go watch," Elizabeth says. "Everyone will expect us to be there."

"Let them expect. I want to stay here with you."

She smiles and settles back against me. We watch the fireworks in silence for a while, colors reflecting on the dark water, explosions echoing across the quarry.

"What are you thinking?" she asks eventually.

"That a month ago I thought this was impossible. You and me. Any kind of future."

"And now?"

"Now..." I search for words. "Now I think maybe it's possible. Not easy. Not guaranteed. But possible."

"Because of today?"

"Because of you. Because you wouldn't let me give up on us. Because you keep fighting for me even when I won't fight for myself." I press a kiss to her hair. "You make me believe I can be better than I thought. Build something more than I imagined. Be someone worth all this faith."

"You already are."

"I'm not. Not yet. But I want to be." I take a breath. "I want to be the person you see when you look at me. The one your father grudgingly gave a chance. The one who builds custom motorcycles and makes you proud."

"I'm already proud."

"Then I want to give you more reasons to be." I tighten my arm around her. "I'm going to work harder than I ever have. Build that motorcycle. Prove to your father and the town and everyone who doubts that I'm not my father's son. That I can be someone worth having."

"Jake—"

"Let me finish." I turn her to face me. "I love you. I've loved you since you first walked into Sam's Garage with that thermos of lemonade. And I promise you—in front of God and the stars and this whole empty quarry—I'm going to spend every day trying to be worthy of that love. Trying to build a future you can be part of. Trying to be the partner you deserve."

Her eyes are wet. "You already are."

"Then I'll keep being that. Every day. Even when it's hard. Even when I'm scared. Even when your father's watching and waiting for me to fail." I brush a tear from her cheek. "You chose me. Over your father's approval, over the town's acceptance, over everything that made sense. I'm choosing you back. Every day. For as long as you'll have me."

"That's a long time."

"Good."

She kisses me again, and this time it's different. Not desperate like after the confrontation. Not fierce like on Main Street. This is slow and deep and full of promise. The kiss of two people choosing each other. Committing to build something together. Taking a leap into an uncertain future.

The fireworks continue overhead. Red and gold and blue lighting up the sky. But we're not watching anymore. Just holding each other at the edge of the quarry where everything started.

"I love you," Elizabeth whispers against my lips.

"I love you too."

"We're really doing this. Building a business, facing my father, defying expectations."

"Yeah. We really are."

"Think we can pull it off?"

I look at her—brave and beautiful and absolutely certain even in the face of impossible odds—and for the first time since her father walked into Sam's Garage with his threats and ultimatums, I let myself believe.

"Yeah," I say. "I think we can."

Not because it'll be easy. Not because we have everything figured out. Not because the path ahead is clear.

But because we're doing it together.

And together, maybe we can do anything.

The fireworks finale starts. Explosions of color filling the sky, reflecting on the water, echoing across the limestone cliffs. And in the middle of it all, Elizabeth and I sit at our quarry, holding each other, watching our town celebrate while we plan our future.

A future built on honest work and stubborn faith and the kind of love that refuses to quit.

A future that's ours.

Finally, impossibly, ours.

The last firework fades, leaving smoke and stars. Elizabeth's head on my shoulder, my arm around her waist, and for the first time in my life I'm not running from my father's shadow or the town's expectations or my own fear of failure.

I'm building something.

With her.

For us.

And that's enough.

More than enough.

Everything.
