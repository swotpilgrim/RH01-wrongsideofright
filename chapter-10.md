# Chapter 10: Wanting More

The secret meetings became a pattern.

Elizabeth would tell her father she was going for a drive or visiting Linda, then meet me at the quarry. I'd take the back roads out of town and find her Chevrolet parked in the clearing.

We'd talk for hours. About books and places we'd never been. About her suffocating life and my dreams beyond the garage. About the impossibility of us and why we were trying anyway.

And we'd kiss—soft kisses that turned breathless before one of us pulled back, remembering all the reasons we had to be smart.

It had been a week since our first kiss. Seven days of stolen time. And with each day, I fell harder.

Thursday evening, Elizabeth brought a blanket and sandwiches, and we had a picnic on the limestone ledge while the sun set. She was telling me about a town council dinner where she'd had to smile through hours of political posturing when she stopped mid-sentence.

"What do you want, Jake?"

The question caught me off-guard. "What do you mean?"

"I mean beyond the garage. Beyond Millbrook. If you could do anything, be anything, what would you want?"

I picked at the sandwich, uncomfortable with the question. Nobody asked me about dreams. Dreams were for people with futures, not guys like me.

"I don't know. Never really thought about it."

"Liar." She bumped my shoulder with hers. "You think about it. I can tell. You get this look sometimes, like you're seeing something nobody else can see."

I was quiet for a long moment, watching the quarry water reflect the sky. Then, because Elizabeth made me brave in ways I didn't understand, I said it out loud.

"Custom motorcycles."

"What?"

"I want to build custom motorcycles. Not just repair work—actual custom builds. Take a frame and engine and create something unique. Art and engineering together." The words came faster once I started. "There's a shop in Indianapolis that does it. Builds bikes for rich guys who want something nobody else has. I've seen pictures in magazines, studied their work. I could do that. I know I could."

Elizabeth was watching me with those blue-gray eyes, and I braced myself for the inevitable dismissal. For her to say it was a nice dream but impractical, that I should be realistic, that guys like me didn't get to build custom bikes for rich clients.

"So why don't you?" she asked instead.

"What?"

"Why don't you do it? Build custom motorcycles?"

I stared at her. "Because it's not that simple. Takes money to start a shop. Equipment. A reputation people trust. And nobody's going to trust Roy Cooper's kid with a custom build worth thousands of dollars."

"Then do it somewhere else. Leave Millbrook. Go somewhere your father's name doesn't matter."

"I can't just leave. My ma's here. Sam gave me a job when nobody else would. This is home, even if it's not much of one."

"But what if you could?" Elizabeth shifted to face me fully. "What if you saved up enough money, learned everything you could from Sam, then moved somewhere bigger? Indianapolis or Chicago or anywhere. Started fresh where nobody knows your history. Built bikes so good people have to pay attention."

The way she said it—like it was possible, like it was a real plan instead of a stupid dream—made my chest tight.

"That's a nice fantasy."

"It doesn't have to be a fantasy. You're eighteen, Jake. You're smart and skilled and good at what you do. Why can't you have what you want?"

"Because people like me don't get what we want. We get what we're given and we're supposed to be grateful for it."

"That's what they tell us." Her voice was fierce. "Your father's legacy, my father's plans—they tell us who we're supposed to be and we're supposed to accept it. But what if we don't? What if we decide we deserve more?"

I looked at her—this beautiful, brilliant girl who believed in me for reasons I couldn't fathom. "You make it sound easy."

"I don't think it's easy. I think it's terrifying and hard and maybe impossible." She took my hand. "But I think it's worth trying. Don't you want to try?"

"Yeah," I admitted. "I do."

"Then let's try. Both of us. You build your bikes. I figure out who I am beyond the mayor's daughter. We can want more, Jake. We're allowed to want more."

Sitting there with her hand in mine and the sunset painting the sky, I almost believed her.

Friday I stayed late at the garage, working on a sketch of a custom bike design I'd been thinking about for months. Just pencil on paper, rough lines showing the frame modifications and engine placement, but it felt important. Real.

Sam found me at my workbench, surrounded by crumpled failed attempts.

"What's this?" he asked, picking up the least terrible sketch.

"Nothing. Just messing around."

He studied it, eyes sharp despite the rough quality of my drawing. "This is good, Jake. Really good. Where'd you learn design like this?"

"Magazines. Looking at custom shops' work, figuring out what makes it work."

"You ever think about doing this professionally? Custom builds?"

The question was so close to what Elizabeth had asked that I laughed. "You're the second person this week to suggest that."

"Smart people, whoever they are." Sam set down the sketch. "You've got talent, kid. Real talent. Wasting it on oil changes and brake jobs seems criminal."

"This is what I've got, Sam. It's enough."

"It doesn't have to be." He gestured at the sketches. "You want my advice? Keep drawing these. Keep learning. Save every dollar you can. Then when you're ready, you take that talent somewhere it can grow."

"You trying to get rid of me?"

"I'm trying to make sure you don't wake up at forty realizing you settled for less than you could've been." His voice was gruff but kind. "Your father settled. Accepted what life handed him and stopped fighting. You're not him, Jake. Don't let this town make you believe you are."

After Sam left, I sat there looking at my sketches, thinking about Elizabeth's belief that I could do this and Sam's certainty I had talent worth developing. Two people who saw something in me I'd never let myself see.

Maybe they were right. Maybe I was allowed to want more.

Or maybe I was setting myself up for disappointment.

Saturday Elizabeth couldn't meet. Town council event at her house. She called the garage—first time ever—and Sam handed me the phone with a knowing look.

"I'm sorry," she said, voice low. "I tried to get out of it."

"It's okay. We'll meet tomorrow."

"I don't want to wait. I want to see you now."

"Your father would notice."

"I know. Doesn't stop me from wanting." She sighed. "I miss you. Is that stupid?"

"If it's stupid, then we're both idiots. I miss you too."

When I hung up, Sam was watching from the doorway.

"You're in deep, aren't you?"

"Too deep to pull back now."

Sam nodded slowly. "Just be careful. When this goes sideways—and it will—that girl's got options you don't. Remember that."

I didn't want to remember. Didn't want to think about how Elizabeth could walk away while I'd lose everything.

Because I was falling in love with her. Maybe already had fallen. And that terrified me more than anything.

Sunday we met at the quarry early, before church let out, stealing an hour while the rest of Millbrook was singing hymns and pretending to be pious. Elizabeth brought coffee in a thermos and we sat drinking it while the morning sun burned off the mist rising from the quarry water.

"Tell me about your mother," she said.

"Not much to tell. She works at Rosie's Diner. Double shifts most days. Tough as nails and twice as stubborn."

"Does she know about me?"

"No. I don't—" I struggled for words. "I don't want to get her hopes up. Or worry her. Depending on how she'd take it."

"You think she'd worry?"

"She'd think the same thing everyone else thinks. That I'm reaching above my station and I'm going to get hurt." I took a drink of coffee. "She'd be right."

"Maybe she'd surprise you."

"Maybe. But I'm not ready to risk it yet."

Elizabeth was quiet for a moment. "My father asked me last night why I've been so distracted lately."

My stomach dropped. "What did you tell him?"

"That I was thinking about college. Future plans. He seemed to accept that." She looked at me. "But he's starting to notice, Jake. I'm slipping. Being less careful about my excuses. Forgetting to be the perfect daughter because I'm too busy being happy."

"We should be more careful."

"I know." She leaned against me, and I wrapped my arm around her shoulders automatically. "But I don't want to be careful. I want to be reckless and stupid and completely honest about how I feel."

"Which is?"

She tilted her face up to look at me. "Happy. Terrified. Like I'm standing on the edge of something huge and I could either fly or fall."

"Yeah," I said. "That's exactly how it feels."

She kissed me then, coffee-flavored and sweet, and for a minute the world was just us and the quarry and the morning sun. No fathers or reputations or impossible futures. Just this.

When we finally pulled apart, Elizabeth rested her forehead against mine. "I don't want to go to church and pretend to be pious. I want to stay here with you."

"Your father would notice."

"I know." She pulled back reluctantly. "Same time tonight?"

"Same time."

I watched her drive away, her Chevrolet disappearing down the quarry road, and stood there in the morning light feeling like I was standing on the edge of something huge myself.

Tommy was right. Sam was right. This was heading somewhere dangerous.

But when Elizabeth looked at me like I was worth believing in, like my dreams were possible and my future was mine to choose, I couldn't make myself walk away.

Even knowing it would probably destroy me to stay.
