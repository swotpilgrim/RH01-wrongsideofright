# Chapter 9: The Line

I spent Sunday trying to talk myself out of wanting her.

The list was long—she was the mayor's daughter, I was Roy Cooper's kid. She had college and a respectable future. I had the garage and a last name that meant failure. Her father would destroy me. The town would turn on her. Different worlds, tracks between them nobody crossed.

The list was logical and true.

And it didn't change a damn thing.

Monday at the garage was torture. Every car, every bolt—my mind kept drifting to Saturday. Elizabeth's arms around me. The quarry at sunset. Her hand touching mine.

"You're distracted," Sam observed, watching me check the same spark plug three times.

"Just being thorough."

"Three times is thinking about someone else." He crossed his arms. "The mayor's daughter was here Saturday evening. Saw her car when I drove past."

My hands stilled. "She had a question. About her oil."

Sam studied me. "That girl's gonna break your heart or get you destroyed. Maybe both. And there's not a damn thing I can say that'll make you walk away, is there?"

"No sir."

"Didn't think so." He sighed. "Just be smart. And when it goes bad—not if, when—you come talk to me first. Deal?"

"Deal."

He left, and I stood there wondering if being smart was even possible when it came to Elizabeth Hayes.

The day dragged. I kept watching the clock, calculating hours until evening, until I could ride to the quarry on the slim chance she'd be there.

We hadn't made plans. Saturday had ended with her walking away, and I had no idea if she wanted to see me again or if that ride had been rebellion already regretted.

But I couldn't stop hoping.

At five I locked up and headed out of town. Told myself I was just clearing my head.

The lie didn't convince me.

The quarry was empty when I arrived. I sat at the limestone edge, watching the water turn from blue to gold, disappointment heavy in my chest.

Then I heard the car.

The Chevrolet's engine was familiar now—that smooth purr of properly adjusted valves, oil changed by her own hands. I stood, heart hammering, as the pale green Bel Air pulled into the clearing.

Elizabeth climbed out, and even from across the clearing I could see her smile.

"Hi," she called.

"Hi." I walked toward her, trying to play it cool, trying not to show how much I'd been hoping she'd come. "Wasn't sure you'd be here."

"I wasn't sure you'd be here either." She met me halfway, and we stood in the clearing like two people who didn't quite know what came next. "I've been thinking about Saturday all week."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." She looked at me, and in the evening light her eyes were more blue than gray. "Have you?"

"Every minute."

The admission hung between us, honest and dangerous. Elizabeth's smile softened.

"Should we sit?"

We walked to the quarry edge and sat like before, legs dangling over water that reflected the sky. The evening was warm, that Indiana summer heat that didn't quit even after the sun started sinking.

"I shouldn't be here," Elizabeth said quietly. "I told my father I was at Linda's studying. He believed me because he always believes me when I say I'm doing something appropriate."

"You don't have to be here. We don't have to—" I struggled for words that wouldn't reveal too much. "This doesn't have to be anything."

"But it is something, isn't it?" She looked at me. "Or am I imagining that?"

"You're not imagining it."

"Then what is it?"

I didn't have an answer. Didn't have words for what I felt when I looked at her, this impossible thing between a girl from the right side of everything and a guy who'd never be right for her.

"It's impossible," I said instead. "That's what it is."

"Why?"

"You know why. Your father. My reputation. The whole town. You've got college ahead of you, a real future. I've got the garage and no prospects beyond it." I picked up a piece of loose limestone, turned it over. "You deserve someone who can give you the life you're supposed to have."

"What if I don't want the life I'm supposed to have?"

"Elizabeth—"

"No, I'm serious." She turned to face me fully. "What if I'm tired of being told what I'm supposed to want? Who I'm supposed to be? The boys my father introduces me to—they're perfectly nice, perfectly respectable, and perfectly boring. They look at me and see the mayor's daughter. A prize to win. A pretty thing to display."

"And what do I see?"

"You see me." Her voice was fierce and certain. "You see that I'm smart and capable and worth more than being decorative. You teach me things instead of patting my head. You talk to me about books and dreams and real things, not just weather and town gossip."

"That doesn't change the facts. Your father would destroy me if he knew about this. The town would turn on you. We're from different worlds, Elizabeth."

"Then maybe we need to stop caring what world we're from." She shifted closer. "Tell me something. If we were different people in a different town where none of that mattered—would you want this? Would you want me?"

The question stole my breath. "That's not fair."

"Answer it anyway."

I looked at her—this beautiful, brilliant girl who had no business wanting anything to do with me. Who brought me lunch and asked about my dreams and looked at me like I was someone worth seeing. Who'd climbed on my motorcycle and held on tight and laughed with pure joy as we rode through the summer evening.

"Yeah," I said. "I'd want you. I do want you. But wanting doesn't change reality."

"What if it does?" She reached out, and her hand found mine on the limestone between us. "What if wanting something enough makes us brave enough to fight for it?"

"You don't know what you're asking for. The judgment, the gossip, your father's anger. You'd lose everything."

"I'd lose things that feel like cages anyway." Her fingers threaded through mine, and the touch made my heart race. "But I'd have something real. Something I chose. Someone who sees me."

"Elizabeth, I'm serious. Your father could make my life hell. Could get me fired. Could make sure I never work in this town again."

"Then we'd leave."

"Just like that? Leave?"

"Why not?" Her grip on my hand tightened. "You said yourself you wanted to build custom motorcycles. You could do that anywhere. And I—" Her voice caught. "I don't want to spend my life as decoration for someone else's ambitions. I want to be real. And when I'm with you, I am."

I should've pulled away. Should've explained all the ways this would end badly. Should've protected her from the hurt that was coming.

But she was looking at me with those blue-gray eyes, and her hand was warm in mine, and I was so tired of doing what I should.

"This is crazy," I said.

"I know."

"It can't work."

"Maybe not."

"Your father will kill me."

"Probably." She smiled, and it was sad and hopeful and brave all at once. "But I don't care. Do you?"

I should've said yes. Should've been smart and careful and protective. Should've thought about consequences and reality and all the reasons this was impossible.

Instead, I leaned in and kissed her.

Or maybe she kissed me. I'd never be sure who moved first, only that suddenly we were kissing and it felt like the first honest thing I'd done in years.

Her lips were soft, tentative, and for half a second my brain screamed at me to stop, to pull away, to protect her from this. From me.

Then she made a small sound in the back of her throat, and her free hand came up to touch my face, and I stopped thinking entirely.

The kiss was gentle, careful, nothing like the kisses I'd imagined in weak moments late at night. This was better—real and sweet and terrifying in its honesty. Her hand was soft against my jaw, her lips moving against mine like a question I was answering with everything I had.

When we finally pulled apart, we sat there breathing hard, foreheads almost touching, the quarry water still and silent below us.

"Jake," she whispered.

"Yeah?"

"I'm not sorry."

I laughed, breathless and overwhelmed. "You should be."

"But I'm not." She pulled back enough to look at me, and her eyes were bright. "Are you?"

Was I sorry? For kissing the mayor's daughter at an abandoned quarry while the sun set over Indiana farmland? For crossing a line we could never uncross? For starting something that couldn't possibly end well?

"No," I said. "I'm not sorry either."

She smiled, and it was like sunrise and sunset and every good thing I'd never thought I deserved all happening at once.

"So what now?" she asked.

"I don't know." I touched her face, marveling that I was allowed to. "This is dangerous."

"I know."

"We have to be careful."

"I know that too."

"Elizabeth—" I struggled to find words for the fear and hope warring in my chest. "I can't promise you anything. Can't promise this'll work out or that I won't mess it up or that your father won't destroy us both for trying."

"I don't need promises." She leaned in and kissed me again, quick and soft. "I just need this. You. Real and honest and worth the risk."

We sat at the quarry's edge as the sky turned from gold to pink to purple, and talked about impossible things. About what we wanted, what we feared, what it might mean to try this anyway. Her hand stayed in mine, and sometimes we'd kiss again—soft, careful kisses that felt like promises we couldn't quite make.

When full dark settled and we finally had to leave, she walked me to my motorcycle.

"Same time tomorrow?" she asked.

"You sure?"

"I've never been more sure of anything." She stood on her toes and kissed me once more. "Be careful riding home."

"You too. And Elizabeth?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For being brave enough for both of us."

Her smile could've lit the whole quarry. "We'll take turns being brave. That's how this works."

I watched her drive away, her taillights disappearing down the quarry road, before I climbed on my Indian and headed back toward town.

Everything had changed. We'd crossed a line we couldn't uncross, started something we couldn't take back.

And I should've been terrified.

But all I felt was hope.
