# Chapter 25: Fourth of July

The town square's packed for Millbrook's Fourth of July celebration. Bunting hangs from every lamppost, red white and blue everywhere I look. The smell of popcorn and cotton candy mixes with summer heat, and somewhere a band's setting up for the parade later.

I'm manning Sam's booth at the fair—just a table with flyers about the garage and some tool displays. Sam thought it'd be good for business. I think it's torture, standing here in my work shirt with grease under my nails while the whole town walks past.

Especially since I know she's here.

Haven't seen her yet, but I feel it. That awareness that comes from knowing Elizabeth's somewhere in this crowd. Been three days since she showed up at the garage and refused to let me push her away. Three days of us being... what? Together again? Trying?

We haven't made it public yet. Haven't told anyone. But today—

"Jake!" Tommy appears with two lemonades, hands me one. "You look like you're facing a firing squad."

"Feel like it."

"Relax. It's just a town fair." He leans against the table. "Though I gotta say, never thought I'd see you voluntarily standing in the middle of Main Street surrounded by the entire population of Millbrook."

"Sam asked."

"Sam asks you to do lots of things. You don't usually say yes to the ones that involve being stared at by half the town."

He's not wrong. I scan the crowd again, looking for—

There.

Across the square, near the town hall steps. Elizabeth's standing beside her father in a white summer dress that catches the sun. Mayor Hayes is in his element, shaking hands and smiling, playing the role. Elizabeth's beside him like she's supposed to be, the perfect daughter.

Our eyes meet across the crowd. Everything else fades. Just her, looking at me. Me, looking back.

"Oh boy," Tommy mutters. "This is gonna be interesting."

I look away first, force myself to focus on the flyers in front of me. But I can feel her watching.

"You two work things out?" Tommy asks quietly.

"Sort of."

"What's sort of mean?"

"Means she showed up and told me to stop being an idiot. Means we're... trying."

"Her father know?"

"Not yet."

"Jake." Tommy's voice is serious. "That's the mayor twenty yards away. And Elizabeth's looking at you like you're water and she's dying of thirst. Something's gonna give."

He's right. I know he's right. But I was hoping for at least today to be normal. To get through the celebration without incident, figure out how to deal with her father later.

Except Elizabeth's moving now. Walking away from her father mid-conversation with some town council member. Linda Miller tries to grab her arm but Elizabeth shakes her off gently, keeps walking.

Straight toward me.

Across the town square. In full view of everyone.

"Oh hell," I breathe.

"Jake—" Tommy starts.

"I know."

People are noticing. Mrs. Patterson stops mid-bite of her funnel cake to watch. Bobby Miller elbows his friend, points. More heads turning. A ripple of attention spreading through the crowd as Elizabeth Hayes, the mayor's daughter, crosses Main Street toward Sam's Garage booth.

Toward me.

My heart's hammering. She's in the middle of the square now, halfway to me, and everyone's watching. Her father hasn't noticed yet—he's still talking to the council member—but Linda's staring after Elizabeth with her mouth open, and the whispers are starting.

"Elizabeth," I say when she's close enough. My voice is low, urgent. "What are you doing?"

"What I should've done weeks ago." She stops right in front of the booth. In front of me. In front of God and the whole town. "Why have you been avoiding me?"

"I haven't—"

"You have. Three days ago you said we'd figure this out together. Since then you've taken every excuse not to see me."

"I've been busy—"

"Don't." Her voice isn't loud but it carries. People are definitely listening now. "Don't lie to me. Not here. Not anymore."

Tommy backs away slowly, giving us space. Or maybe just getting clear of the blast zone.

"Elizabeth." I try to keep my voice down even though half the square is watching. "This isn't the place—"

"When is the place, Jake? When you're ready? When you've convinced yourself you're worthy enough? When you've found the perfect moment that'll never come?" She's not yelling but there's steel in her voice. "I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of hiding."

"Your father's right there." I nod toward the town hall steps where Mayor Hayes is still oblivious, but not for long. "People are staring."

"Let them stare."

"Elizabeth, please." I'm begging now, aware of every eye on us. "Just go back. We can talk about this later. Somewhere private."

"No." She crosses her arms. "I'm done with private. Done with secret meetings at the quarry. Done with pretending we're not..." She stops, takes a breath. "Done with you deciding for me what I can handle."

The crowd's growing. People drifting over to see what's happening. I recognize faces—Mrs. Henderson, Jim from the hardware store, half of Elizabeth's classmates. This is a disaster.

"You're making a scene," I say quietly.

"Good."

"Your reputation—"

"Is mine to risk." She steps closer to the booth. Closer to me. "You told me three days ago we'd figure this out together. So here I am. In front of everyone. Asking you a question."

My mouth's dry. "What question?"

"Do you love me or not?"

The square goes quiet. Or maybe it's just that all I can hear is my heartbeat pounding in my ears. She asked loud enough that people nearby definitely heard. And now they're waiting.

Everyone's waiting.

For me to answer.

I look past her and see Mayor Hayes has finally noticed. He's frozen mid-handshake, staring across the square at his daughter standing in front of my booth. His face is turning red even from here.

"Elizabeth," I try again, quieter. "Your father's watching."

"I don't care. Answer the question." Her eyes are locked on mine. "Do you love me?"

I could lie. Could tell her no and end this, protect her from the gossip and judgment that's about to rain down. Could give her an out, let her walk away with her dignity intact.

But looking at her face—brave and determined and absolutely certain even while every eye in Millbrook watches—I can't make the lie come out.

"Yes," I say. Quiet. Just for her.

"What?" Someone nearby. "What'd he say?"

Elizabeth heard me though. I can see it in her eyes. "Say it again. Louder."

"Elizabeth—"

"Say it." Not angry. Not demanding. Just... steady. Sure. "Say it so everyone can hear. Do you love me?"

This is it. The moment where I either commit or run. Where I either trust that maybe she's right about us, or prove her father correct about me being a coward.

Mayor Hayes is pushing through the crowd now. I can see him coming, face thunderous, but he's on the other side of the square and there are too many people in his way.

I look at Elizabeth. Just Elizabeth. The girl who keeps fighting for me even when I won't fight for myself. Who drove to the garage and refused to let me push her away. Who's standing here in front of the entire town asking me to be brave.

"Yes," I say. Louder this time. Loud enough that people nearby hear. "Yes, I love you."

The whispers explode. Gasps and exclamations and I can hear Mrs. Patterson's scandalized "Well I never" from ten feet away. But I'm not looking at them. I'm looking at Elizabeth, and she's smiling through tears.

"Was that so hard?" she asks.

"Terrifying."

"Good." She reaches across the booth, takes my hand right there in front of everyone. "Because I love you too. And I'm done hiding it."

Her hand in mine feels like both the safest and most dangerous place in the world. Every person watching is going to talk. This'll be the scandal of the summer. Her father's going to lose his mind.

But Elizabeth's looking at me like none of that matters.

And maybe she's right.

Maybe it doesn't.

"Elizabeth!" Mayor Hayes's voice carries across the square. He's closer now, almost here, and he looks furious.

She squeezes my hand. "Ready?"

"No."

"Me neither." She smiles despite everything. "But we're doing this anyway."

Her father reaches us, breathing hard, face red. "Elizabeth. What do you think you're doing?"

"Telling the truth." She doesn't let go of my hand. "I love Jake. And I'm not hiding it anymore."

The mayor looks at our joined hands, at me, at the crowd watching. His jaw works. "We'll discuss this at home."

"No." Elizabeth's voice is calm but absolute. "We'll discuss it here. Now. In front of everyone. Because I'm done with private confrontations where you threaten people and manipulate situations. If you have something to say about Jake, say it to both of us."

Mayor Hayes's eyes narrow. He glances at me. "You told her."

"He told me you threatened his mother," Elizabeth says before I can respond. "And Sam. And him. That you tried to blackmail him into leaving town."

The crowd's reaction is immediate. More gasps. Whispers getting louder. The mayor's face goes from red to white.

"Elizabeth, that's—this isn't—" He's sputtering now, aware of all the eyes on us. "We'll talk about this privately."

"Why? Afraid people will hear that you threatened a teenager? That you tried to destroy people's livelihoods to control your daughter?"

"I was protecting you—"

"You were controlling me. There's a difference." She takes a breath. "And I'm done being controlled."

The mayor looks at her, at me, at the crowd. For the first time since I've known him, he looks unsure. Outmaneuvered.

"This isn't over," he says quietly.

"No," Elizabeth agrees. "But it's not going to be fought in private anymore either."

She turns back to me, and despite everything—the staring crowd, her furious father, the disaster of this moment—she's smiling.

"Come on," she says. "Let's go watch the parade."

And she pulls me out from behind the booth, our hands still joined, and walks with me through the crowd.

People part. Stare. Whisper.

But Elizabeth doesn't care.

And for the first time in my life, neither do I.
