# Chapter 17: Being Seen

I knew this was a bad idea the second Elizabeth suggested it. But when she asked if we could do something normal—just grab a Coke like any other couple—I couldn't say no.

Now we're in a red vinyl booth at Miller's Pharmacy, two Cokes sweating onto the white Formica between us, and every instinct's screaming this is a mistake.

"You're doing that thing again," Elizabeth says softly.

"What thing?"

"That thing where you look ready to bolt." She reaches across the table like she'll take my hand, then pulls back. Even she knows we gotta be careful.

"I'm not—" But I am. I've been scanning the room since we sat down, cataloging every person. Old Mr. Patterson reading the newspaper. High school girls giggling over milkshakes. Bobby Miller near the window.

"Jake." Elizabeth's voice pulls me back. "It's just a Coke."

"It's not just a Coke." I lean forward, keep my voice low. "It's the mayor's daughter having a Coke with the guy from Sam's Garage. That's what people are gonna see."

"Maybe I want them to see." There's that stubborn tilt to her chin that I've come to recognize. The one that means she's made up her mind and arguing is pointless.

"Elizabeth—"

"We can't hide forever. And I'm tired of acting like what we have is shameful. Like I should be embarrassed to be seen with you."

"I never said that."

"You imply it every time we meet at the quarry. Every time you park two blocks away. Every time you look around like you're doing something wrong." Steel underneath the softness. "I love you, Jake. I'm not ashamed of that."

My chest tightens at hearing her say it so plainly, even whispered. Three days since we admitted it to each other, and it still hits me like a punch every time.

"I know you're not," I say. "But that doesn't change what this means. Once people know for sure—"

"They already suspect."

"Suspecting and knowing are different things." I glance around again. Nobody's openly staring, but I can feel the attention. The kind of noticing that happens in small towns where everyone's trained to observe without looking like they're observing. "Suspicion gives you room to deny. This makes it real."

"My father's going to find out eventually," she says. "Wouldn't it be better if we controlled how?"

"And you think this is controlling it?"

"I think hiding makes us look guilty. But we're not doing anything wrong, Jake."

There's everything wrong with it when one of those people is Elizabeth Hayes and the other is me. But I don't say that because I've already said it a dozen times and she refuses to hear it.

The bell above the door jingles. We both look up as Mrs. Patterson walks in—church secretary, biggest gossip in Millbrook, and one of the mayor's supporters. Perfect.

"Maybe we should go," I mutter.

"We just got here."

"Elizabeth—"

But it's too late. Mrs. Patterson's spotted us, her face cycling through surprise, recognition, and scandalized delight. She heads to the counter, eyes darting back to our booth.

"She's seen us," I say quietly.

"Good." Elizabeth's chin lifts. "Let her look."

Mrs. Patterson will tell Mrs. Henderson, who'll tell Sarah, who'll tell everyone at church. By tomorrow, half the town will know.

The high school girls are whispering now, not even pretending to hide their stares. One of them—Linda Miller, Elizabeth's friend—looks concerned. The other looks thrilled, like she's witnessing scandal firsthand and can't wait to spread it around.

"Elizabeth." Bobby Miller's walking over. Great. "Hey."

"Hi, Bobby." Elizabeth's voice is perfectly pleasant and completely unconcerned.

Bobby's eyes slide to me, then back. "Didn't expect to see you here."

"Why not? I get thirsty like everyone else."

"Sure, yeah. You want to come sit with us? Linda's over there."

It's an escape hatch. A way for Elizabeth to leave without making it obvious she was here with me on purpose.

"Thanks, but I'm fine here," Elizabeth says.

Bobby's eyebrows go up. "You sure?"

"Positive."

He looks between us, and I can see him putting the pieces together. His expression shifts from confused to understanding to something that might be pity.

"Okay. Well. See you around, I guess."

"See you Monday," Elizabeth says brightly.

Bobby walks back to his table. Immediately every head leans in and the whispers start. I don't need to hear the words to know what they're saying.

"You should've gone with him," I say.

"I don't want to sit with Bobby."

"It would've given you an out. Would've made this look less—"

"Less like what it is?" She leans forward. "I'm here with you because I want to be."

"People are staring."

"Let them."

"This is your reputation."

"It's my choice."

God, she's stubborn. Brave and completely unaware of how brutal this town can be when you step outside the lines. Or maybe she is aware and doesn't care.

I force myself to take a drink of my Coke. It's cold and sweet and tastes like trouble. The condensation makes my hand wet, and I set the glass down carefully on the napkin underneath.

"How's the garage?" Elizabeth asks, like we're having a completely normal conversation and half the room isn't watching us.

"Fine. Sam's got me working on Mrs. Henderson's Chrysler. Transmission's shot."

"You'll fix it. You're good at that."

"It's just a transmission."

"It's what you do." She smiles. "You take broken things and make them work again."

There's weight behind those words, meaning that has nothing to do with car parts. I look at her across the table—mayor's daughter in a pale blue dress with her hair curled perfect, sitting across from me in my work clothes with grease probably still under my fingernails—and wonder what she sees that makes her think I'm the one fixing anything.

The bell jingles again. This time it's Jim Cooper—no relation, but he runs the hardware store and knows my mother from the diner. He spots us immediately, does a visible double-take, and his eyebrows disappear into his hairline.

"Word's spreading," I say.

Elizabeth follows my gaze. "Good."

"You keep saying that."

"Because I mean it." She reaches across the table and this time she does take my hand, right there in the middle of Miller's Pharmacy soda fountain where anyone can see. Her fingers are soft and cool from the Coke glass. "I'm not hiding anymore, Jake."

My heart's pounding so hard I'm surprised the whole room can't hear it. Her hand in mine feels like the most natural thing in the world and the most dangerous. I should pull away. Should protect her from this choice she's making without fully understanding the consequences.

But I don't. I let her hand stay in mine, feel the warmth of her skin, and try not to think about the explosion that's coming when her father hears about this.

"You're gonna regret this," I say quietly.

"I won't."

"Your father—"

"Will have to accept that I make my own choices." Her grip tightens. "I'm seventeen, not twelve. I'm allowed to have a Coke with whoever I want."

She's allowed. But that doesn't mean there won't be hell to pay.

We sit there for another ten minutes, drinking our Cokes slowly, talking about nothing important—the weather, Sam's new project car, a book Elizabeth's reading. Surface conversation while the real drama plays out in the looks and whispers around us.

When we finally stand to leave, I'm acutely aware of every eye tracking our movement. Mrs. Patterson's abandoned all pretense of subtlety and is openly watching. The high school girls are whispering frantically. Even Mr. Patterson has lowered his newspaper to observe our exit.

I walk Elizabeth out, and on the sidewalk she turns to face me. "Thank you."

"For what? Letting you destroy your reputation?"

"For trusting me." She touches my arm briefly, nothing scandalous but intimate enough that anyone looking would understand. "For being brave enough to be seen with me."

That's backwards. She's the brave one. I'm just the idiot who can't say no to her.

"I'll see you tomorrow?" she asks.

"Quarry at seven?"

"Perfect." She smiles, and for a second—despite the gossip and the stares and the disaster I know is coming—everything feels worth it.

I watch her walk away down Main Street, her blue dress swaying, her shoulders straight and proud. Then I turn and head back toward the garage, my hands in my pockets, trying to ignore the weight of every stare following me.

By the time I get back to Sam's, Tommy's there working on a carburetor. He looks up when I walk in, takes one look at my face, and whistles low.

"What'd you do?"

"Had a Coke with Elizabeth at Miller's."

"In public?"

"Yeah."

"Jesus, Jake." He sets down his wrench. "You got a death wish?"

"Something like that."

"Her father's gonna lose his mind."

"I know."

"Half the town probably knows by now."

"I know that too."

Tommy studies me for a minute. "Worth it?"

I think about Elizabeth's hand in mine across that white Formica table. Her stubborn chin and brave eyes. The way she looked at me like I was worth being seen with.

"Yeah," I say. "It was."

Tommy shakes his head but he's almost smiling. "You're either the bravest guy I know or the dumbest."

"Can't it be both?"

He laughs and tosses me a rag. "Get to work, Romeo. If you're gonna get yourself killed, might as well fix some cars first."

I catch the rag and head to my workbench, but my mind's still back at that soda fountain. Still feeling Elizabeth's hand in mine. Still seeing the way she looked at everyone watching us with her chin up and her shoulders back, like she was daring them to say something.

She said she's not ashamed. That she's tired of hiding. And sitting there with her, pretending we were just two normal people having a normal Coke on a normal afternoon, I almost believed it could be that simple.

But I know better. The whispers that started today are just the beginning. By tonight, the whole town will know. By tomorrow, it'll reach her father.

And then the real trouble starts.

I pick up my wrench and get to work on the engine in front of me, trying not to think about the engine of gossip and judgment I can feel revving up all over Millbrook. Elizabeth thinks being seen together is taking control. Making a choice.

Maybe she's right. Or maybe we just lit a match and handed it to everyone who's been waiting for an excuse to watch us burn.

Either way, there's no going back now.
