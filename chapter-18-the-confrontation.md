# Chapter 18: The Confrontation

She's late.

I've been at the quarry since six-thirty—half hour early because I couldn't stay at the garage anymore. Now it's almost seven-thirty and she's still not here.

The sun's setting, throwing long shadows across the limestone. Every time I hear an engine I look up. But the road stays empty.

Elizabeth's never late. Something's wrong.

I light a cigarette but my hands are shaking. The gossip from yesterday spread through town like wildfire. If word reached her father...

Headlights cut through the dusk. I'm on my feet before the car stops. The Buick's door opens and Elizabeth gets out, and I can see something's wrong. Her movements are jerky, wrong.

"Elizabeth." I'm halfway to her when she looks up, and my heart drops. She's been crying—her eyes red and swollen, mascara smudged dark under them.

"Jake." Her voice breaks on my name.

Then she's in my arms, crying for real now. Harsh sobs that wrack her whole body. I hold her tight and don't say anything. Just hold her while she falls apart.

Takes five minutes before she can breathe steady. She pulls back, wipes her eyes. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late, I just—"

"What happened?"

"My father." The words come out bitter. "He heard. About yesterday. About us at Miller's."

Of course he did. I knew he would. Whole town knew by nightfall. "What'd he say?"

She laughs bitterly. "What didn't he say?" She walks to the limestone edge, wraps her arms around herself. "He was waiting when I got home. Called me into his study. I knew as soon as I saw his face."

I follow but don't touch her. Just stand close. "Tell me."

"He said—" Her voice cracks. She takes a breath, tries again. "He said Mrs. Patterson called him this afternoon. Told him his daughter was making a spectacle of herself at the soda fountain with that Cooper boy. That people were talking. That it was inappropriate and I was damaging his reputation and mine."

The words land like punches. "Elizabeth—"

"He asked what I thought I was doing. If I understood what people were saying about me." She's staring at the water. "He said you were wrong side trash with a drunk for a father and no future. That I was throwing away everything."

Each word is a knife. I want to argue, but how can I? Her father's right.

"What'd you say?"

"I tried to tell him you're not what he thinks. That you're smart and hardworking and kind." Her hands are fists. "He wouldn't listen. Just kept listing all the reasons you were unsuitable."

"He's not wrong." The words taste like ash.

"Yes, he is." She spins to face me, eyes blazing. "He's completely wrong. But he won't see it."

"So what'd he say? When you defended me?"

"He said I was being naive. That I was infatuated with the idea of rebellion, of being with someone dangerous. That in a few months I'd realize what a mistake I was making and be grateful he protected me from myself." Her voice drips with anger. "Like I'm a child who doesn't know her own mind."

I can picture it. Mayor Hayes in his study, all authority, laying down the law.

"He forbid me from seeing you," she says quietly. "Said I wasn't to speak to you, go to the garage, have any contact at all. If I defied him there would be consequences."

The end I knew was coming. "What kind of consequences?"

"He didn't specify. But he was so angry, Jake. I've never seen him that angry."

"You should listen to him."

"What?"

"He's your father. He's trying to protect you."

"From you?" She steps closer. "You think I need protection from you?"

"Yeah. Your father's right about me, Elizabeth. I got nothing to offer you. My old man's a drunk who abandoned us. I work in a garage for barely enough. What kind of future is that?"

"The kind I want." Her hands are on my face. "Don't do this. Don't let him get in your head."

But he's just saying what I've known all along. "He's trying to give you a good life."

"He's trying to control my life." Her voice is fierce. "There's a difference. I told him I love you."

My heart stops. "You told him what?"

"That I love you. That this isn't some teenage rebellion or infatuation. That I love you and I'm not giving you up just because he doesn't approve."

"Jesus, Elizabeth." I pull away from her, run my hands through my hair. "You can't—you shouldn't have said that."

"Why not? It's true."

"Because now he knows." I turn to face her. "Now he knows this isn't just some passing thing. Now he knows he's gotta do whatever it takes to end it."

"Let him try."

"He's the mayor. He's got power, connections. He can make my life hell, Elizabeth. Can make Sam's life hell. Can make sure I never work anywhere in this county. You don't understand what you're up against."

"Then tell me." She's right in front of me again, stubborn and brave and completely unafraid. "Tell me what he can do. Because I need to know what we're fighting."

"We're not fighting anything. You're gonna go home and tell your father you were upset but you've thought about it and he's right. Tell him it's over between us."

"No."

"Elizabeth—"

"No." Her voice is absolute. "I'm not doing that. I'm not giving up on us just because my father throws a tantrum."

"This isn't a tantrum. This is your future."

"Exactly. My future. Not his." She takes my hands. "Jake, listen to me. My father doesn't get to decide who I love. That's my choice. And I choose you."

I want to believe her. God, I want to believe her so badly it hurts. But I've seen what happens when people like us try to be with people like her. Seen how the town crushes anything that doesn't fit into its neat little boxes.

"What'd he say?" I ask quietly. "When you told him you loved me?"

Her face crumples slightly. "He said that just proves I don't understand what love really requires. That real love is sacrifice and responsibility and thinking about the future. That if I really loved you I'd want what's best for you, and that's not—" Her voice catches. "That's not being with someone who'll drag you down."

The words hit exactly where they're supposed to. Because maybe he's right. Maybe loving her means letting her go before I ruin everything good about her life.

"He thinks I'm gonna drag you down," I say.

"He's wrong."

"Is he?" I look at her—mayor's daughter with tears on her face because of me, fighting with her father because of me, reputation in tatters because of me. "Look what knowing me has already done. Your father's furious. The town's talking. You're crying at a quarry instead of home where you should be."

"Where I should be is with you."

"Elizabeth—"

"No. Stop trying to push me away. Stop trying to protect me from you like you're some kind of disease I need to be cured of." Her voice is shaking with anger and hurt and frustration. "You're not poison, Jake. You're not wrong or bad or any of the things people say. And I'm not giving up on us because my father or the town can't see what I see."

"And what do you see?"

"I see you." She touches my chest, right over my heart. "I see someone who works harder than anyone, who takes care of his mother, who's loyal and honest and brave. I see someone who treats me like I matter, like my thoughts and opinions are worth hearing. I see someone worth fighting for."

I catch her hand, hold it against my chest where my heart's hammering. "Your father sees someone who'll ruin your life."

"My father sees what he wants to see. What fits his narrative." She steps closer. "But I see the truth. And the truth is I love you, Jake Cooper. And no matter what my father says or does, that's not changing."

I pull her against me, rest my chin on top of her head, and close my eyes. She's shaking—from anger or hurt or fear, I can't tell. Maybe all three.

"This is gonna get worse," I say into her hair. "Your father's not gonna just let this go."

"I know."

"He's gonna try everything to break us up."

"I know."

"You could lose things. Your family, your reputation, maybe even college if he's mad enough."

"I know." She pulls back to look at me. "But I'm not losing you. That's the one thing I'm not willing to lose."

The conviction in her voice terrifies me because I can see the disaster coming. Can see all the ways this ends badly. But looking at her face—determined and scared and absolutely certain—I don't have the strength to do what I should do. To walk away, to end this before it destroys us both.

"We should go," I say finally. "It's getting dark. Your father's probably worried."

"I don't care if he's worried."

"Elizabeth." I smooth her hair back from her face. "You gotta go home eventually."

"I know." She leans into my touch. "I just—I needed to see you. To tell you what happened. To make sure you weren't—" She doesn't finish but she doesn't have to.

"Wasn't what? Gonna run?"

"Something like that."

I kiss her forehead. "I'm not running. But I'm not dragging you down either. We gotta figure this out."

"Together," she says.

"Together," I agree, even though I have no idea how we're gonna make this work. Her father's made his position clear. The town's made its judgment. And me? I'm just a guy from the wrong side of the tracks who fell in love with someone I got no business loving.

But she's here, in my arms, telling me she's not giving up. And I'm not strong enough to be the one to walk away.

So I hold her while the last light fades and the stars come out overhead, and I try not to think about all the ways her father's right about me. Try not to think about how loving her might be the most selfish thing I've ever done.

Because the truth is, I'm not strong enough to let her go. Even knowing I should. Even knowing I'm not worthy of her faith.

I'm just gonna hold on as long as she'll let me. And hope somehow we figure out a way through this that doesn't destroy us both.
