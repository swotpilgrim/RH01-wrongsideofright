# Chapter 26: Public Truth

I can feel every eye on us.

The crowd's grown since Elizabeth asked me that question. People abandoning their booths to see what's happening. Mrs. Patterson with her funnel cake, Jim from the hardware store, half of Elizabeth's graduating class. Even the band's stopped setting up.

Everyone's watching the mayor's daughter hold hands with Roy Cooper's kid in the middle of Main Street.

The whispers are getting louder. Speculation spreading like wildfire through the crowd. I catch fragments—"Did you hear?" "The mayor's daughter?" "Roy Cooper's boy?" Each word a judgment, a confirmation of everything they've always thought about me.

And somewhere in the crowd, Mayor Hayes is pushing toward us. I can see him over Elizabeth's shoulder, face thunderous, jaw set. Twenty yards away and closing. Linda Miller tries to stop him but he brushes past.

Ten seconds before he reaches us and this gets ugly.

I could still fix this. Could let go of Elizabeth's hand, step back, tell everyone it was a misunderstanding. Tell her no, I don't love her, this was all a mistake. Protect us both from what's coming—the gossip, the judgment, her father's wrath.

One word. That's all it would take.

But Elizabeth's looking at me like I'm the only person who matters. Like the crowd and her father and all of Millbrook don't exist. Just me and her and the truth between us.

I can't lie to that face.

"Yes," I say again. Louder this time so the people pressing closer can hear. "I love you. I've loved you since you first walked into Sam's Garage acting like you knew everything about carburetors."

A sound ripples through the crowd. Gasps, murmurs, someone's shocked laughter quickly stifled.

Elizabeth's eyes fill with tears but she's smiling. "Keep going."

"I pushed you away because I thought that's what protecting you meant. Thought loving you meant letting you go before I could drag you down." My throat's tight but the words keep coming. "But I've been miserable without you. Every day's been hell. And I'm done pretending I don't love you just because the whole town thinks I shouldn't."

More whispers. Bobby Miller says something to his friend and they both stare. Mrs. Henderson has her hand over her mouth.

"What else?" Elizabeth asks softly.

"What else what?"

"What else have you been too scared to say?"

I glance past her. Her father's fifteen yards away now. Almost here. But Elizabeth's still waiting, still asking me to be brave.

"That you're the best thing that's happened to me," I say. "That being with you makes me want to be better. That I don't deserve you but I'm selfish enough to want you anyway." I swallow hard. "That I'm terrified of not being enough. Of messing this up. Of becoming my father and ruining everything good."

The crowd's completely silent now. Even the whispers have stopped. Just me and my fears laid out in front of the whole town.

Elizabeth takes both my hands, holds them tight. Her eyes are wet but her voice is steady. "You're nothing like your father."

"You don't know that."

"I do. Your father ran from his responsibilities. You face yours. He made excuses. You make efforts. He hurt people who loved him. You protect them." She squeezes my hands. "You're nothing like him, Jake. And I'm tired of you using his shadow as an excuse."

"Your father—"

"Doesn't get to decide my life." Her voice rises slightly. "He doesn't get to decide who I love or who I see or what I risk. That's my choice."

Mayor Hayes breaks through the final ring of onlookers. His face is red, jaw clenched. "Elizabeth. We're leaving. Now."

She doesn't even look at him. Just keeps her eyes on mine. "Are you going to let him decide for both of us?"

It's the same question she asked three days ago at the garage when she refused to let me push her away. The same challenge. The same test of whether I'll trust her enough to fight.

"No," I say. The word comes out stronger than I feel. "No, I'm not."

"Good." She turns to face her father, still holding my hand. "Neither am I."

The mayor's eyes narrow. "Elizabeth, this is not the time or place—"

"This is exactly the time and place." Her voice carries across the square. "You've been making decisions about my life in private for months. Threatening people, manipulating situations, trying to control who I see. I'm done with private. If you have something to say about Jake, say it here."

Mayor Hayes looks around at the crowd. At the faces watching, listening, waiting. This is his nightmare—a public confrontation where he can't use his position or threats to get his way.

"We'll discuss this at home," he says tightly.

"We'll discuss it now." Elizabeth's grip on my hand is iron. "You told Jake he wasn't good enough for me. That he's Roy Cooper's son and that means something in this town. That being with him would ruin my future."

More gasps from the crowd. The mayor's face goes from red to white.

"You threatened his mother's job," Elizabeth continues. "Sam's business. Jake's employment prospects. You gave him an ultimatum—leave town or watch everyone he cares about suffer."

Someone in the crowd says, "He did what?" Another voice: "Richard, is that true?"

The mayor looks trapped. Cornered. For the first time since I've known him, he looks unsure of his control.

"I was protecting you—" he starts.

"You were controlling me," Elizabeth interrupts. "There's a difference. And I'm done being controlled."

I should say something. This is my fight too. But Elizabeth's handling it, and I'm too stunned by her courage to do anything but stand here and hold her hand.

"This young man—" the mayor starts, turning to the crowd like he's addressing a town meeting.

"Has a name," Elizabeth says. "Jake. His name is Jake Cooper. And you're going to stop pretending he doesn't exist because it's convenient for you."

The mayor's jaw works. "Jake, then. He has no prospects. No future to offer you. No—"

"He has himself," Elizabeth says. "That's enough for me. The question is whether it's enough for you. Whether you trust me to know my own mind. Whether you love me enough to let me make my own choices even if they're not the ones you'd make for me."

She's turned this from being about me to being about him. About whether he'll choose control or connection with his daughter.

Mayor Hayes looks at Elizabeth. Really looks at her. I can see the war in his face—anger and fear and love all tangled together.

"You're seventeen," he says finally. Quieter. "You think you know what you want but—"

"I'm almost eighteen. Old enough to vote, old enough to marry without your permission in three months, old enough to make my own decisions." She takes a breath. "I love him, Dad. I love Jake. And you can accept that or you can keep trying to control it, but either way it's the truth."

Dad. That's the first time she's called him that instead of "Father" or "the mayor" this whole conversation. Something shifts in his face.

"He can't provide for you," the mayor says, but there's less certainty in his voice now.

"Maybe not the way you'd provide. But he sees me. He values me. He treats me like a person, not a possession or a political asset." Elizabeth's voice softens slightly. "Isn't that worth something?"

The crowd's watching this like it's better than any Fourth of July entertainment. I can see Mrs. Patterson crying into her handkerchief. Bobby Miller looks stunned. Sam's standing near the back with his arms crossed, and when he catches my eye he nods once. Approval.

"I won't support this," Mayor Hayes says. But it's not a threat anymore. It's almost a plea.

"I'm not asking for your support," Elizabeth says gently. "Just asking you not to sabotage it. Can you do that?"

The mayor looks at her. Then at me. His eyes are hard, measuring, searching for something. I don't know what he's looking for but I meet his gaze and don't flinch.

"If he hurts you—" the mayor starts.

"Then I'll deal with it. My choice, my consequences." Elizabeth squeezes my hand. "But he won't. Because Jake's spent months trying not to hurt me by pushing me away. Even when it hurt him. That's not the behavior of someone who'll hurt me carelessly."

The mayor's silent for a long moment. The whole square waits.

"I don't like this," he says finally.

"I know."

"I think you're making a mistake."

"That's my right."

"And if this ends badly—"

"Then I'll learn from it. But Dad?" Elizabeth waits until he meets her eyes. "Stop trying to control my life. Please. It's not working and it's just pushing me away from you."

Something in Mayor Hayes breaks. I can see it in his face—the moment he realizes he's losing his daughter by trying to hold on too tight.

"This isn't over," he says. But it's not the threat from three weeks ago in Sam's office. It's resignation. Acceptance that he can't fight this.

"No," Elizabeth agrees. "But maybe it can be different. If you're willing."

The mayor looks at me one more time. "Hurt her and you'll answer to me. Publicly or privately, I don't care which."

"I won't," I say. My voice comes out rough. "I promise, sir. I won't."

He nods once. Then turns and walks away through the parting crowd. People watch him go, then turn back to us like they're not sure what just happened.

Elizabeth's shaking. I can feel it in her hand. "Did we just—did that really—"

"Yeah," I say. "That really just happened."

"The whole town saw."

"Yeah."

"Everyone's going to talk."

"Definitely."

She looks up at me, and despite everything—the staring crowd, her father's grudging retreat, the scandal we've just created—she's smiling. "Good."

Then she kisses me. Right there in the middle of Main Street with half of Millbrook watching.

And I kiss her back. Because I'm done hiding. Done pretending. Done letting fear make my decisions.

When we finally pull apart, Mrs. Patterson is fanning herself and Bobby Miller's jaw is on the ground. Tommy's grinning like he just won a bet. Sam nods again, approval clear on his weathered face.

"Come on," Elizabeth says. "Let's go watch the parade."

And she pulls me through the crowd, our hands still joined, past the whispers and stares and shocked faces.

For the first time since my father left, I walk through Millbrook with my head up.

Not as Roy Cooper's kid.

As Jake Cooper. Elizabeth Hayes's boyfriend. The guy from Sam's Garage.

Myself. Just myself.

And somehow, that's enough.
